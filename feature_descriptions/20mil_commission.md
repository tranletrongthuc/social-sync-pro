### **Phase 1: The Foundation (Week 1: Days 1-7)**

This week is all about setup and strategy. You won't post any affiliate links yet. The goal is to build a professional, trustworthy foundation.

- **Day 1: Create Your Brand & Persona**
    - **Task:** Define who you are. Are you a "Modern Pet Parent," a "Vet-Approved Nutrition Guide," or a "Luxury Pet Stylist"?
    - **App Feature:** Go to the **"Brand Kit"** section. Use the **AI-Powered Brand Kit Generator** by inputting your core idea (e.g., `"A trusted guide for Vietnamese pet owners seeking high-quality, healthy pet food and stylish, durable accessories."`).
    - **Task:** Define your ideal customer.
    - **App Feature:** Go to the **"Personas"** tab. Create a detailed persona for your target customer (e.g., "Linh, 28, a marketing manager in HCMC who treats her Corgi like her child and shops online for premium products"). This will be your "Persona Bible" and will make all future AI-generated content sound authentic.
- **Day 2-3: Build Your Affiliate Vault**
    - **Task:** Gather all your affiliate product links for pet food, treats, toys, beds, leashes, etc.
    - **App Feature:** Go to the **"Affiliate Vault"** tab. Click **"Add New Link"** for each product, entering its name, your unique link, and the 8% commission rate. If you have a spreadsheet, use the **"Import from File"** button to upload everything at once.
    - **Pro Tip:** Include a mix of everyday items (food, treats) for recurring sales and high-ticket items (smart feeders, designer beds) for bigger commission wins.
- **Day 4-5: Initial Content Strategy & Trend-Spotting**
    - **Task:** Find out what pet owners in Vietnam are talking about right now.
    - **App Feature:** Go to the **"Content Strategy"** tab. Use the **AI-Powered Trend Suggestion** feature. Select "Industry Specific" and type in "pet care in Vietnam" to get a list of current trends.
    - **Task:** For the top 2-3 trends, click **"Generate Ideas"** to get a list of relevant content angles. This is your initial pool of ideas.
- **Day 6-7: Generate Your First Sales Funnel Campaign**
    - **Task:** Create your first two weeks of content automatically.
    - **App Feature:** Go to the **"Media Plan"** tab and click **"Create Funnel Campaign"**.
        - **Campaign Name:** "Pet Wellness Kickstart"
        - **Primary Objective:** Select a popular product from your **Affiliate Vault** (e.g., "Organic Salmon Dog Food").
        - **Target Audience:** Select the "Linh, the Corgi Mom" persona you created.
        - **Duration:** "2 Weeks".
    - The AI will now generate a complete content plan with posts strategically categorized for **Awareness, Consideration, and Decision**. This is the content you will use for the next two weeks.

### **Phase 2: Build Trust & Authority (Week 2: Days 8-14)**

This week is about posting valuable content to attract your audience. You will primarily use the "Awareness" and "Consideration" posts generated by the app.

- **Daily Task (30 mins): Review & Refine**
    - **Task:** Each day, review the posts scheduled for the next 2-3 days.
    - **App Feature:** Click on a post in your Media Plan. Use **"Refine Content"** to tweak the text to perfectly match your persona's voice. Use **"Generate Image"** with a detailed prompt (e.g., `"A happy Corgi dog sitting next to a stylish food bowl in a bright, modern apartment in Vietnam, photorealistic"`).
- **Daily Task (30 mins): Schedule & Engage**
    - **Task:** Schedule your polished posts to go out automatically.
    - **App Feature:** Use the **Bulk Scheduling** feature to set your content for the week.
    - **Task:** Actively engage with the community. Search for pet-related hashtags in Vietnam (#thucung, #yeucho, etc.), follow other pet accounts, and leave genuine comments. This builds your audience.
- **Content Focus (No Direct Selling Yet):**
    - **Awareness Posts:** "5 Human Foods That Are Toxic to Dogs," "How to Choose the Right Leash for Your Pet."
    - **Consideration Posts:** "Our Guide to Reading Pet Food Labels," "Why Vets Recommend Grain-Free Diets."

### **Phase 3: Drive Action & Generate Sales (Week 3: Days 15-21)**

Now that you've built trust, it's time to introduce your affiliate products. You will now use the "Decision" stage posts from your campaign.

- **Daily Task: Refine & Post "Decision" Content**
    - **Task:** Focus on refining the posts that directly promote products.
    - **App Feature:** These posts will have been generated by the **Funnel Campaign** wizard. Your job is to make them compelling. Use the **"Believable Persona"** strategy: write as if you are genuinely recommending a product you love.
    - **Example Post:** "I've been asked a lot about what I feed my Corgi. We switched to [Product Name] a month ago and his energy is through the roof! The ingredients are amazing. If you want to check it out for your own furry friend, you can find it here." (Your affiliate link is automatically suggested).
- **Day 21: Plan for the Future**
    - **Task:** Generate your *next* 2-week sales funnel campaign.
    - **App Feature:** Go back to the **"Media Plan"** tab and create another **Funnel Campaign**. This time, choose a different product from your **Affiliate Vault** (e.g., a high-tech pet accessory) to keep your content fresh.

### **Phase 4: Retain, Analyze & Scale (Week 4: Days 22-30)**

This week is about building a loyal community, analyzing what worked, and scaling your efforts.

- **Daily Task: Post "Retention" & New "Awareness" Content**
    - **Task:** Post content designed to build community (e.g., "Show us your pets! Tag us at #[YourBrandHashtag] for a chance to be featured!").
    - **Task:** Start publishing the "Awareness" posts from the *new* campaign you generated on Day 21. This keeps the sales cycle moving smoothly.
- **Day 28-30: Analyze & Optimize**
    - **Task:** Review your performance.
    - **App Feature & External:** Check your affiliate platform's dashboard to see which products generated the most clicks and sales. Inside SocialSync Pro, see which posts got the most likes and comments.
    - **Task:** Double down on what works. Did a specific product sell really well?
    - **App Feature:** Go to the **"Content Strategy"** tab, select that winning product from your **Affiliate Vault**, and use the **"Generate Content Package"** feature. This will create a dedicated, multi-platform campaign specifically to promote that high-performing product.

By following this 30-day plan, you are not just randomly posting. You are building an automated, strategic content machine that builds trust and systematically guides customers towards a purchase, moving you closer to your 20,000,000 VND goal.
