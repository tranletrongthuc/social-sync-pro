## What are realistic AI photos?

Realistic AI photos are images generated by artificial intelligence that closely resemble real-life scenes, objects, or people. These visuals are not just outputs of a random algorithm. They are crafted through an intricate process of training AI with large datasets of real images, and fine-tuned through user-provided guidance.

The appeal of realistic AI photos lies in their versatility. They can elevate campaigns with customized visuals, create lifelike mockups for design projects, or bring abstract ideas to life. The key lies in understanding how to use the tools at your disposal effectively, and refining your approach as you experiment.

## 8 prompt details to make realistic AI photos

1.  **Lighting:** Lighting can make or break the illusion of realism. Without clear lighting instructions, your AI photo risks looking flat or unnatural. Take the time to imagine the scene's light and describe its specifics vividly. When designing a prompt, consider these elements to mimic authentic lighting conditions.
    - **Type of light:** Specify whether you want soft, diffused light or hard, direct light in the image. Phrases like “soft natural lighting” or “studio spotlight with defined shadows” help AI understand your intention.
    - **Source and direction:** Where is the light coming from? A prompt like “morning sunlight streaming through a window from the left” adds layers of believability.
    - **Color temperature:** Define whether your lighting has warm, golden tones or cool, blue undertones. For example, “dusk lighting with a warm glow” creates atmosphere.

2.  **Camera settings:** If you want your AI-generated photo to look like it was taken with a professional camera, referencing camera settings is invaluable. Treat camera settings as an integral part of your prompt development to exude expertise and professionalism. These can affect tone, depth, and visual fidelity.
    - **Aperture** impacts focus and depth of field. For instance, include “f/1.8 for shallow depth of field” to emphasize a dreamy, blurred background.
    - **Shutter speed** determines motion and sharpness. Add “fast shutter speed for crisp detail” to clarify your preferences to AI models.
    - **ISO levels** control brightness and noise. Use prompts like “low ISO for sharp image clarity” where detail is paramount.

3.  **Resolution:** Resolution serves as the backbone of a high-quality photo. The perceived realism rests heavily on the level of detail. Providing guidance on resolution helps sharpen textures, making your image feel tangible. Including it in your prompt ensures your AI image is crisp and suitable for large-screen or close-up viewing.
    - Use phrases like “high-resolution texture with fine detail” or “1080p clarity” to emphasize sharpness.
    - Avoid overly vague descriptors; be specific about the quality you need, such as “4K resolution for lifelike definition.”

4.  **Depth of field:** The depth of field conveys where the focus lies and how sharp or blurred the surroundings are. Harnessing the depth of field creates layers of intricacy that immerse viewers in your AI-generated visuals. By guiding this aspect, you can simulate professional photography techniques.
    - Phrases like “shallow depth of field with soft bokeh” draw attention to a single subject, like a portrait.
    - For fully in-focus scenes, specify “deep depth of field, crisp from foreground to background.”

5.  **Negative prompts:** Negative prompts are equally pivotal. They guide AI by specifying what not to include, ensuring the focus stays on your vision.
    - Use exclusions like “no distortion, unnatural colors, or unrealistic textures” for polished results.
    - Remove unintentional artifacts by including commands to avoid “blurred edges, mixed anatomy, or exaggerated lighting effects.”

6.  **Mixing styles:** Experimenting with multiple artistic styles can make your AI photos memorable. Carefully blending influences enhances realism while preserving a unique aesthetic.
    - Consider combining prompts like “realistic photography blended with soft painterly highlights” for dramatic effect.
    - Stay consistent by specifying how much each style contributes, such as “80% realism and 20% surrealism.”

7.  **Facial proportions:** When working on human portraits, attention to facial proportions is paramount. The subtler the details, the more lifelike your portraits become. AI can misstep here, so provide guidelines for symmetry and anatomical balance.
    - Highlight specifics, such as “aligned eyes, balanced facial symmetry, and proportionate jawlines.”
    - Avoid exaggeration by specifying “natural realism, no cartoonish features.”

8.  **Atmosphere and mood:** Creating a cohesive atmosphere ties your AI photo together. Atmosphere and mood infuse personality into your images, elevating their impact and storytelling potential. Think about the emotion you want it to evoke, and use descriptive words to guide the tone.
    - Phrases like “serene and tranquil forest scene with muted colors” set the mood.
    - For something bolder, specify “high-energy urban environment with vibrant tones.”

## Post-processing techniques

After generating your AI image, post-processing can further elevate its realism. Learning how to edit AI-generated images is essential to refine details, correct inconsistencies, or enhance quality. Tools like Wixel often integrate with post-editing platforms, making it easier to fine-tune your image without having to start from scratch.

Here are a few techniques to consider:

*   **Color grading:** Adjust the image's color tones to create harmony with your intended mood or aesthetic. Subtle changes in contrast and saturation can make significant differences.
*   **Sharpen focus:** Use photo editing tools to enhance textures or bring clarity to specific elements. Blurred edges or unnatural transitions can be softened or sharpened during this phase.
*   **Lighting adjustments:** Refine highlights and shadows to improve depth. Pay close attention to areas where light naturally interacts with surfaces in your image.

## Ethical considerations

The creativity unlocked by AI tools also brings ethical responsibilities. Ethical use of AI not only builds trust with your audience, but also promotes a healthy creative ecosystem. When creating realistic AI photos, consider the following:

*   **Transparency:** Be upfront about the origins of the image, especially in professional settings. Clearly label AI-generated visuals to avoid misleading viewers.
*   **Permission:** Avoid using reference images or datasets without proper authorization. Always give credit where due if elements of your image are based on someone else's work.
*   **Cultural sensitivity:** Ensure your creations don't appropriate or misrepresent cultural symbols or practices. Use AI responsibly to respect artistic and cultural diversity.
