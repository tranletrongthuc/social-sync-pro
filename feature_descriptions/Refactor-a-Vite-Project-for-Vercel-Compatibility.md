**Role:** You are an expert software engineer specializing in modern web development with Vite, React, and Vercel. Your task is to refactor a project's file structure to resolve a deployment conflict on Vercel.

-----

**Project Context:**
The current project is a Vite-based React application. The main entry point file (`index.tsx`) and its associated CSS (`index.css`) are located in the project's root directory, alongside `index.html` and `package.json`. This structure causes a conflict with Vercel's routing rules, where a root `index.tsx` file is incorrectly treated as a Serverless Function, causing `500` errors.

**Current (Problematic) Directory Structure:**

```
/
├── api/
│   └── (serverless functions...)
├── index.css
├── index.html
├── index.tsx  <-- The problematic file
├── package.json
└── ... (other config files)
```

**Content of `index.html`:**

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    ...
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/index.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

-----

**Primary Goal:**
Refactor the project to follow the standard Vite project structure by moving all frontend source files into a `/src` directory. This will resolve the conflict with Vercel's deployment rules and allow the project to build and run correctly.

-----

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Create a `/src` Directory:** In the project's root, create a new directory named `src`.

2.  **Move Frontend Source Files:** Move all relevant frontend source files from the root directory into the new `/src` directory. Based on the project context, this includes at least:

      * `index.tsx`
      * `index.css`
      * *(Also move any other component files like `App.tsx`, or folders like `/components`, if they exist in the root)*

3.  **Update `index.html`:** Modify the `index.html` file in the root directory. Update the path in the `<script>` tag to point to the new location of `index.tsx`.

      * **Find this line:**
        ```html
        <script type="module" src="/index.tsx"></script>
        ```
      * **Change it to:**
        ```html
        <script type="module" src="/src/index.tsx"></script>
        ```

-----

**Output Format:**
Please provide a summary of the actions taken and show the final, corrected code for the `index.html` file.

**Example of Desired Output:**
"I have restructured the project as requested.

1.  A new `/src` directory has been created.
2.  The files `index.tsx` and `index.css` have been moved into the `/src` directory.
3.  The `index.html` file has been updated to reflect the new path.

Here is the updated content for `index.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    ...
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/index.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
