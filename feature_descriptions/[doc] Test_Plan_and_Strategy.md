# Test Plan and Strategy: SocialSync Pro

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-08-25
**Author:** QA Team
**Status:** Active

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the SocialSync Pro application. The purpose of this plan is to ensure that the application meets the highest standards of quality, functionality, and reliability before its public release. It details the scope of testing, the methodologies to be used, the resources required, and the criteria for success.

---

## 2. Quality Objectives
-   **Functionality:** Ensure that 100% of the functional requirements outlined in the Business Requirements Document (BRD) are tested and working as expected.
-   **Reliability:** Achieve a 95% pass rate for all planned End-to-End (E2E) test cases.
-   **Stability:** Ensure there are zero (0) open Blocker or Critical severity bugs at the time of release.
-   **Usability:** Validate that the application is intuitive and that a new user can complete the core workflow without significant friction.
-   **Performance:** Confirm that the application remains responsive under typical load, with AI generation tasks providing clear feedback to the user.

## 3. Scope of Testing

### 3.1. In-Scope
-   **All User-Facing Features:** Every feature detailed in the User Manual will be tested, including:
    -   Brand Kit & Media Plan Generation
    -   Post Creation, Refinement, and Image Generation
    -   Scheduling and Publishing
    -   Strategy Hub, Affiliate Vault, and Persona Management
-   **Backend Functionality:** All BFF endpoints will be tested to ensure they handle requests correctly, manage authentication with external services, and return appropriate responses/errors.
-   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Testing will be performed on the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
-   **UI/UX:** The application will be tested for visual consistency, responsiveness, and adherence to UI mockups.

### 3.2. Out-of-Scope
-   **Third-Party Infrastructure:** We will not test the internal workings or uptime of external services like Airtable, Gemini, or Cloudinary. We will only test our integration with their public APIs.
-   **Hardware/Network Testing:** Testing will not cover specific hardware configurations or network-related issues outside of normal web conditions.
-   **Load/Stress Testing (V1):** Formal, large-scale load and stress testing is out of scope for the initial release but is recommended for future versions.

## 4. Testing Levels & Methodology

A multi-layered testing approach will be used to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### 4.1. Unit Testing
-   **Objective:** To verify that individual functions and components work correctly in isolation.
-   **Responsibility:** Developers.
-   **Tools:** Jest / Vitest.
-   **Methodology:** Developers will write unit tests for new functions and components, particularly for business logic in services and BFF endpoints.

### 4.2. Integration Testing
-   **Objective:** To verify the interaction between different components, primarily the communication between the Frontend and the Backend-for-Frontend (BFF).
-   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers & Developers.
-   **Methodology:** Tests will be designed to simulate frontend calls to the BFF and assert that the correct data is returned or actions are performed. This ensures that the contract between the client and server is solid.

### 4.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
-   **Objective:** To simulate real user journeys from start to finish, ensuring the entire system works together as a cohesive whole.
-   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers.
-   **Tools:** Playwright.
-   **Methodology:** The detailed E2E testing strategy is outlined in the **`e2e-testing-plan.md`** document. Automated scripts will execute the user journeys defined in that plan. Key journeys include:
    -   Admin Login and Project Management.
    -   Full Brand Kit Generation from a single idea.
    -   Media Plan creation via the wizard.
    -   Post refinement, image generation, and scheduling.
    -   CRUD operations in the Affiliate Vault and Personas tabs.

### 4.4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
-   **Objective:** To have a sample of end-users (or internal stakeholders) validate that the application meets their needs and the business requirements.
-   **Responsibility:** Beta Users / Key Stakeholders.
-   **Methodology:** A UAT plan with specific scenarios will be provided to testers. They will execute these scenarios and provide feedback, which will be reviewed before the final release.

---

## 5. Test Environment & Tools
-   **Test Environment:** A staging environment, which is a complete replica of the production environment on Vercel, will be used for all QA and E2E testing.
-   **Test Data:** A dedicated Airtable base will be used for the staging environment to avoid corrupting production data.
-   **Defect Management Tool:** GitHub Issues will be used to report, track, prioritize, and manage all identified bugs.
-   **Automation Framework:** Playwright for E2E test automation.

---

## 6. Defect Management Process
1.  **Reporting:** Bugs are reported in GitHub Issues with a clear title, description, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and severity level.
2.  **Triage:** The Project Manager and Lead Developer will review new bugs to confirm their validity and assign a priority.
3.  **Assignment:** Bugs are assigned to a developer for fixing.
4.  **Resolution:** Once fixed, the bug is deployed to the staging environment.
5.  **Verification:** The QA Engineer re-tests the bug to confirm it has been resolved and closes the issue.

**Severity Levels:**
-   **Blocker:** Prevents major functionality; no workaround.
-   **Critical:** A major feature is broken, or data loss/corruption occurs.
-   **Major:** A major feature is not working as expected.
-   **Minor:** A minor feature is not working, or a UI issue is present.

## 7. Entry & Exit Criteria

### 7.1. Entry Criteria (To begin formal QA cycle)
-   All code for the planned features has been successfully deployed to the staging environment.
-   All unit tests are passing.

### 7.2. Exit Criteria (To approve release)
-   All E2E test cases have been executed, and the pass rate is 95% or higher.
-   There are zero (0) open Blocker or Critical bugs.
-   All high-priority Major bugs have been resolved.
-   User Acceptance Testing has been completed and signed off by stakeholders.
