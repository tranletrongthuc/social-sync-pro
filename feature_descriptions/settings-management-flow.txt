This settings management flow is designed to provide a flexible yet controlled experience, beginning with a global configuration and allowing for specific customization at the brand level.

1. Admin Configuration
The process begins in the AdminPage, where an Admin establishes the foundational settings for the entire application.

Global Defaults: The Admin defines the default settings that act as a baseline template. These configurations are stored in the Admin_Settings table.

Service & Model Management: The Admin curates a list of available AI services and their associated models. These are managed in the AI_Services and AI_Models tables and represent the complete set of options that can be offered to users.

2. Brand Initialization
When a new brand is created in the system, its settings are not created from scratch. Instead, they are automatically initialized by copying the current global defaults from the Admin_Settings table. This ensures every new brand starts with a consistent, pre-configured baseline.

3. User Customization
Users can tailor settings specifically for their brand through the Settings modal.

Loading Current Settings: When a user opens the modal, it first fetches and displays that brand's currently saved settings. On first open, this will be the initial defaults. On subsequent opens, it will be their previously saved customizations.

Modification and Saving: The user can modify any setting, including selecting different AI services and models from the list managed by the Admin. Upon saving, these changes are updated and stored specifically for that brand, overriding the initial defaults.

4. Use cases:
Use Case 1: Admin Establishes or Updates Global Defaults
This flow covers the initial setup and any subsequent changes to the application's baseline settings.

User Action (UI): The Admin navigates to the AdminPage. They change one or more setting values (e.g., toggle a feature on, change a text label, set a default quota) and click the "Save Global Settings" button.

Application Logic: The frontend application collects all the setting values from the form. It then makes an API call (e.g., PUT /api/admin/settings) to the backend, sending the complete set of default settings in the request body. After receiving a success confirmation, the UI might show a "Settings Saved" notification.

Database Interaction: The backend server receives the API request. It validates the data and then executes an UPDATE query on the Admin_Settings table. This single query overwrites the existing default values with the new ones provided by the Admin.

Use Case 2: Admin Manages Available AI Services
This covers adding or removing the AI service options that will be available to users.

User Action (UI): In the AdminPage, the Admin navigates to the "Manage Services" section.

To Add: They click "Add New Service," fill out a form with the service name, description, and perhaps model associations, then click "Save."

To Remove: They find an existing service in the list and click the "Remove" or "Delete" icon next to it, then confirm the action in a prompt.

Application Logic:

On Add: The frontend sends a POST /api/admin/services request with the new service's data.

On Remove: The frontend sends a DELETE /api/admin/services/{service_id} request.

In both cases, upon a successful response, the frontend UI automatically refreshes the list to reflect the change.

Database Interaction:

On Add: The backend executes an INSERT statement to add a new record to the AI_Services table (and potentially the AI_Models table if models are added simultaneously).

On Remove: The backend executes a DELETE statement to remove the corresponding record from the AI_Services table. It might also need to handle cascading deletes or prevent deletion if the service is currently in use by brands.

Use Case 3: A New Brand is Created
This is the automated flow that provisions a new brand with its initial settings.

User Action (UI): This is typically triggered by a different system action, like an Admin filling out a "Create New Brand" form or a new customer completing a signup flow. The final action is clicking "Create Brand."

Application Logic: When the brand creation process is triggered on the backend, the application's business logic performs a critical internal step before finalizing the creation. It first queries the database for the current global defaults. It then uses this data to construct a new settings object specifically for the brand-to-be-created.

Database Interaction: This involves a sequence of operations:

SELECT * FROM Admin_Settings: The application first reads the single row of global default settings.

INSERT INTO Brands (...): The new brand record is created in the Brands table.

INSERT INTO Brand_Settings (...): A new record is created in a Brand_Settings table (or similar). This record stores the copied default settings and is explicitly linked to the newly created brand's ID.

Use Case 4: User Customizes Their Brand's Settings
This is the core flow for brand-level personalization.

User Action (UI): A User logs into their brand's account and clicks the "Settings" button. The Settings modal appears.

Application Logic (on Modal Open): The frontend initiates two parallel API calls to efficiently gather all necessary data:

Fetch user-specific settings: GET /api/brands/{brand_id}/settings

Fetch available options: GET /api/services and GET /api/models
The application then populates the modal's form fields. It uses the data from the first call to set the current values and the data from the second call to populate the dropdown menus (e.g., the list of available AI models).

Database Interaction (on Modal Open):

The first API call triggers a SELECT * FROM Brand_Settings WHERE brand_id = ? to get that specific brand's saved settings.

The second API call triggers a SELECT * FROM AI_Services and SELECT * FROM AI_Models to retrieve all possible options curated by the Admin.

User Action (UI - Saving Changes): The user changes a value in the modal (e.g., selects a different AI service from a dropdown) and clicks "Save Changes."

Application Logic (on Save): The frontend gathers the new values from the modal form and sends a PUT /api/brands/{brand_id}/settings request with the updated data. On success, it displays a confirmation message and closes the modal.

Database Interaction (on Save): The backend receives the request and executes an UPDATE Brand_Settings SET ... WHERE brand_id = ?, overwriting that brand's specific settings with the new, customized values. The global defaults in Admin_Settings are completely unaffected.
