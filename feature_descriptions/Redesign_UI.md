# Technical Plan: Mobile-First Responsive Redesign

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-09-14
**Status:** Proposed

---

## 1. Objective

This document outlines the technical strategy to refactor the SocialSync Pro application into a fully responsive platform. The goal is to ensure a seamless, intuitive, and performant user experience that is **fully responsive across all devices**, from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors. The design process will prioritize mobile-first principles to build a solid foundation that scales up elegantly to desktop.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

1.  **Mobile-First, Desktop-Adapted:** All components and layouts will be designed for mobile screens first to ensure a baseline of accessibility and performance. Desktop and tablet views are considered equally important and will be implemented as enhancements that take full advantage of the extra screen space, using `min-width` media queries.
2.  **Fluid & Adaptive Layouts:** Use flexible grids, flexbox, and relative units (`%`, `rem`, `em`) instead of fixed pixel widths. This ensures that every component fluidly adapts to any screen size, providing an optimal viewing experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop without awkward breaks or horizontal scrolling.
3.  **Touch-Friendly Interactions:** All interactive elements (buttons, links, tabs) must have large enough touch targets (minimum 44x44px) and appropriate spacing to be easily used on a touch screen.
4.  **Universal Performance:** Prioritize fast load times on all devices by optimizing assets, lazy-loading components, and minimizing the initial JavaScript bundle. Performance on mobile networks is a key benchmark.

## 3. Global Layout Redesign

The current desktop-centric layout will be replaced with a responsive shell that adapts its navigation based on the viewport.

### 3.1. Desktop Layout (`>= 1024px`)
-   **Navigation:** A persistent, full-featured sidebar on the left for main navigation (Brand Kit, Personas, Media Plan, etc.).
-   **Content Area:** A multi-column layout will be used where appropriate (e.g., `StrategyDisplay` with its two-column design).

### 3.2. Tablet Layout (`>= 768px`)
-   **Navigation:** The sidebar will collapse into an icon-only "rail" to maximize horizontal space for content. A hamburger menu icon can reveal the full sidebar text labels.
-   **Content Area:** Content will reflow to a simpler two-column or single-column layout.

### 3.3. Mobile Layout (`< 768px`)
-   **Navigation:** The sidebar will be completely hidden. Primary navigation will move to a **Bottom Tab Bar** for the most common views (e.g., Media Plan, Strategy, Personas).
-   **Header:** A minimal top header will contain the brand name, a "Settings" icon, and a "Notifications" icon for background tasks.
-   **Content Area:** All content will be displayed in a single, scrollable column.

## 4. Component-Specific Redesign Plan

Each major component of the application will be refactored as follows.

### 4.1. Main Navigation (`MainDisplay.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`)
-   **Desktop:** Keep the existing sidebar.
-   **Mobile:**
    -   Create a new `BottomTabBar.tsx` component. It will render icons and labels for 3-5 primary destinations.
    -   The `activeTab` state in `App.tsx` will be driven by this new component on mobile.
    -   The existing sidebar component will be conditionally rendered only on larger screens.

### 4.2. Content Feeds (`MediaPlanDisplay.tsx`, `Posts.tsx`)
-   **Desktop:** Can remain a grid or multi-column list of `PostCard` components.
-   **Mobile:**
    -   The layout must collapse to a single-column vertical feed.
    -   `PostCard.tsx` must be refactored to be 100% width, with its internal elements (image, text, actions) stacking vertically if needed.
    -   Infinite scroll pagination is critical and must be fine-tuned for touch-based scrolling.

### 4.3. Modals (`PostDetailModal.tsx`, `SettingsModal.tsx`, `MediaPlanWizardModal.tsx`)
-   **Desktop:** Can remain as centered, modal dialogs with a backdrop.
-   **Mobile:**
    -   All modals should be refactored to become full-screen "sheets" that slide up from the bottom of the screen.
    -   This provides more vertical space for content and feels more native to the mobile experience.
    -   The modal header should contain a prominent "Close" or "Done" button.

### 4.4. Data Tables (`AffiliateVaultDisplay.tsx`)
-   **Desktop:** The existing table layout is acceptable.
-   **Mobile:**
    -   Tables are not mobile-friendly. The table view must be replaced with a list of `ProductCard.tsx` components.
    -   Each card will represent one row of the table, displaying the most important information (e.g., product name, price, rating) in a clear, readable format.
    -   Actions like "Edit" or "Delete" will be buttons on the card.

### 4.5. Two-Column Views (`StrategyDisplay.tsx`)
-   **Desktop:** The current two-column layout (Navigation Sidebar + Main Content Area) is effective.
-   **Mobile:**
    -   The layout should collapse into a single view.
    -   The `NavigationSidebar` (listing trends) could become a dropdown menu at the top of the page or a separate view.
    -   When a trend is selected, the `MainContentArea` (trend details) would replace the list view, with a clear "Back" button to return to the list.

### 4.6. Forms & Inputs (`PersonaEditorModal.tsx`, `SettingsModal.tsx`)
-   **Desktop:** No major changes needed.
-   **Mobile:**
    -   All text inputs, textareas, and select dropdowns should be styled to be 100% width of their container.
    -   Font sizes for inputs must be at least `16px` to prevent iOS from automatically zooming in on focus.
    -   Labels should be placed above their corresponding inputs for clarity.

### 4.7. Unified Page Structure (New)

**Problem:** The main content tabs (`Media Plan`, `Content Strategy`, `Affiliate Vault`, `Personas`) each have a unique, custom-built layout structure and header. This creates a jarring and inconsistent user experience, making the application harder to navigate and learn.

**Solution:** A standardized page view component will be created and implemented across all main tabs to enforce a consistent look and feel.

#### 4.7.1. `StandardPageView.tsx` Component

A new reusable component, `StandardPageView.tsx`, will be created. Its responsibilities will be:

-   **Consistent Header:** To render a standardized page header that includes:
    -   A large, prominent `title`.
    -   A descriptive `subtitle` in a smaller font.
    -   A relevant `icon` for visual identity.
-   **Action Slot:** To provide a designated slot in the header for page-specific action buttons (e.g., "New Plan", "Add Persona").
-   **Content Wrapper:** To provide a main content area with consistent padding and scrolling behavior.

#### 4.7.2. Refactoring Plan

Each of the following components will be refactored to use `StandardPageView`:

-   **`MediaPlanDisplay.tsx`:**
    -   Its custom header will be removed.
    -   Title, subtitle, and icon will be passed as props to `StandardPageView`.
    -   The action buttons ("New Plan", "Funnel Campaign") will be passed into the `action` slot of the `StandardPageView` header.
    -   The core content (sidebar for plans + main post feed/calendar) will be rendered as children.

-   **`ContentStrategyPage.tsx`:**
    -   Will be refactored similarly to `MediaPlanDisplay`, passing its title, subtitle, icon, and action buttons to the `StandardPageView`.

-   **`AffiliateVaultDisplay.tsx`:**
    -   Its custom header and KPI cards will be integrated into the new standard layout.
    -   The main content (filters and product cards) will be rendered as children.

-   **`PersonasDisplay.tsx`:**
    -   Its header will be removed and its properties passed to `StandardPageView`.
    -   The main grid of persona cards will be rendered as children.

**Benefit:** This approach will dramatically improve UI consistency, making the application feel more professional and intuitive. It also improves code maintainability by centralizing the page layout logic into a single component.

## 5. Technical Implementation Strategy

### 5.1. Styling (CSS)
-   **Adopt Mobile-First Media Queries:** All base styles will be for mobile. Enhancements for larger screens will be wrapped in `min-width` media queries.
    ```css
    /* Mobile-first base styles */
    .card {
      width: 100%;
    }

    /* Tablet and up */
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
      .card {
        width: 50%;
      }
    }

    /* Desktop and up */
    @media (min-width: 1024px) {
      .card {
        width: 33.33%;
      }
    }
    ```

### 5.2. Responsive Logic (React)
-   **Create a `useBreakpoint` Hook:** A custom hook will be created to detect the current viewport size.
    ```typescript
    // src/hooks/useBreakpoint.ts
    import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

    const getBreakpoint = (width: number) => {
      if (width < 768) return 'mobile';
      if (width < 1024) return 'tablet';
      return 'desktop';
    };

    export const useBreakpoint = () => {
      const [breakpoint, setBreakpoint] = useState(getBreakpoint(window.innerWidth));

      useEffect(() => {
        const handleResize = () => {
          setBreakpoint(getBreakpoint(window.innerWidth));
        };
        window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
        return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
      }, []);

      return breakpoint;
    };
    ```
-   **Conditional Rendering:** Use the `useBreakpoint` hook to conditionally render different components for mobile vs. desktop (e.g., `BottomTabBar` vs. `Sidebar`).
    ```tsx
    // App.tsx
    const breakpoint = useBreakpoint();

    return (
      <div>
        {breakpoint === 'desktop' && <Sidebar />}
        <MainContent />
        {breakpoint === 'mobile' && <BottomTabBar />}
      </div>
    );
    ```

## 6. Phased Rollout Plan

The redesign will be implemented iteratively to manage complexity.

1.  **Phase 1: Global Layout & Navigation:**
    -   Implement the `useBreakpoint` hook.
    -   Create the responsive main application shell.
    -   Build the `BottomTabBar` for mobile and implement conditional rendering for navigation.

2.  **Phase 2: Core Content Views:**
    -   Refactor `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx` and `PostCard.tsx` to be fully responsive.
    -   Refactor `StrategyDisplay.tsx` to use the single-column/accordion pattern on mobile.

3.  **Phase 3: Modals & Forms:**
    -   Refactor all major modals (`PostDetailModal`, `SettingsModal`, etc.) to use the full-screen "sheet" pattern on mobile.

4.  **Phase 4: Secondary Views:**
    -   Refactor `AffiliateVaultDisplay.tsx` and other table-based views to use the card-list pattern on mobile.
    -   Ensure all remaining pages and components are fully responsive.

5.  **Phase 5: Performance & Testing:**
    -   Conduct thorough performance testing on real mobile devices.
    -   Perform cross-browser and cross-device QA to fix layout bugs.
