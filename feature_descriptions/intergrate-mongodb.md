You are a senior Full-Stack Engineer and data migration specialist. Your expertise lies in refactoring complex applications, swapping out backend services, and ensuring a smooth transition with minimal disruption to the frontend. You are an expert in the MERN stack and Vercel serverless architecture.

Project Context:
* Application: SocialSync Pro, a full-stack social media management tool.
* Frontend: A Vite-powered React/TypeScript SPA in the src/ directory.
* Backend: Node.js serverless functions in the api/ directory, deployed on Vercel.
* Incumbent Database: Airtable, with all backend logic contained in api/airtable/ and api/lib/airtable.js. The frontend interacts with it via src/services/airtableService.ts.
* Target Database: MongoDB Atlas.

Primary Goal:
Your mission is to execute a complete and total migration of the application's persistence layer from Airtable to MongoDB Atlas. You will replace every piece of Airtable-related logic with a MongoDB equivalent, ensuring the application is fully functional on the new database. The primary strategy is to keep the public API contract (routes and data structures) as stable as possible to minimize frontend refactoring.

Step-by-Step Technical Plan:

Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration

1. Manage Dependencies:
   * Add the official mongodb Node.js driver.
   * Completely remove the airtable package as it will no longer be used.

2. Configure Environment:
   * Direct the user to create a .env.local file for the MONGODB_URI connection string. Provide a placeholder and an explanation.

3. Establish Connection Utility:
   * Create a reusable and performant connection handler for the serverless environment at api/lib/mongodb.js. This utility must cache the connection across function invocations to prevent overwhelming the database.

Phase 2: Backend API Migration

This is the core of the migration. You will systematically refactor every file in the api/airtable/ directory.

1. General Instructions for Refactoring:
   * For each file, replace the Airtable SDK logic with the equivalent logic using the Node.js mongodb driver.
   * Use the connection utility created in Phase 1 to interact with the database.
   * Map Airtable concepts to MongoDB: an Airtable "Table" should become a MongoDB "Collection". Use logical collection names (e.g., personas, mediaPlanPosts).

2. Critical Data Structure Transformation:
   * MongoDB uses an _id field of type ObjectId as its primary key. The existing frontend code expects an id field of type string, as provided by Airtable.
   * For all data returned from the API, you must transform the data before sending the response. Create a new id field containing the string representation of _id and remove the _id
	 field to maintain the API contract.
   * Example Transformation: ({ _id, ...rest }) => ({ id: _id.toString(), ...rest })

3. Refactor Specific Endpoints:
   * Go through each file in api/airtable/ (e.g., load-personas.js, load-media-plan-posts.js, [action].js, etc.).
   * For each file, provide the full, refactored code that performs the original function's purpose using MongoDB.

Phase 3: Frontend & Cleanup

1. Refactor Frontend Service:
   * Rename src/services/airtableService.ts to src/services/databaseService.ts to reflect its new, generic role.
   * Review the contents of the newly renamed file. While API routes are unchanged, you must double-check that any data types or structures still align with what the frontend components
	 expect. Make minor adjustments if necessary.

2. Update Imports:
   * Identify all files in the src/ directory that import from the old airtableService.ts.
   * Provide a list of these files and instruct the user on how to update the import paths to point to databaseService.ts.

3. Delete Obsolete Code:
   * Delete the now-unused Airtable library file: api/lib/airtable.js.

Desired Output Format:
Provide a clear, step-by-step response with the following sections:

1. Dependency Commands: The shell commands for installing mongodb and uninstalling airtable.
2. Environment Setup: The code block for the .env.local file.
3. MongoDB Connection Utility: The complete, commented code for api/lib/mongodb.js.
4. Backend API Refactoring: For each file in api/airtable/, provide a heading with the filename and a code block containing its new, fully refactored MongoDB implementation.
5. Frontend Service Refactoring: A code block with the complete code for the new src/services/databaseService.ts.
6. Frontend Import Updates: A list of all file paths within src/ that need their import statements updated.
7. Final Cleanup: A confirmation that api/lib/airtable.js should be deleted.
8. Concluding Summary: A brief summary of the completed migration and advice on how to populate the new MongoDB collections with data to test the application.
