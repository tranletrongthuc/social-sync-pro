## 2. Project Goals and Objectives
The primary objective is to deliver a robust, scalable, and user-friendly platform that achieves the business goals outlined in the Business Requirements Document (BRD). Key success metrics include:
-   **Functionality:** Deliver all in-scope features as defined in the BRD.
-   **Quality:** Achieve a 95% pass rate for all critical-path test cases with no outstanding blocker/critical bugs at launch.
-   **Schedule:** Adhere to the major milestones outlined in Section 4.
-   **User Adoption:** Onboard a target number of beta users and achieve a high satisfaction rating.

## 6. Risk Management

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R-01** | **Third-Party API Changes:** An external service (e.g., Gemini, Facebook) makes a breaking change to its API. | Medium | High | The BFF architecture provides a layer of abstraction. Changes can be managed in a single location on the backend without requiring a full frontend redeployment. | 
| **R-02** | **Scope Creep:** Additional feature requests are made mid-sprint, threatening the schedule. | High | Medium | Strictly adhere to the scope defined in the BRD. All new requests must go through a formal change control process. | 
| **R-03** | **AI Model Performance/Cost:** The primary AI model becomes too expensive or its quality degrades. | Medium | High | The Admin Panel is designed to allow for the easy addition and swapping of AI models, providing flexibility to adapt to the market. | 
| **R-04** | **Data Schema Limitations:** The Airtable schema proves insufficient for future feature requirements. | Low | High | Plan for a potential future migration to a more robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL) as a long-term scalability improvement. |

## 7. Communication Plan
-   **Daily Stand-ups:** 15-minute meetings for the core development team to discuss progress, plans, and blockers.
-   **Weekly Team Meetings:** 1-hour meeting to review the past week's progress and plan the upcoming week's work in more detail.
-   **Monthly Stakeholder Updates:** A summary report and demo will be provided to key stakeholders to keep them informed of project progress against milestones.
-   **Primary Tools:** Slack for daily communication, Jira/GitHub Issues for task and bug tracking, Confluence/Notion for documentation.
