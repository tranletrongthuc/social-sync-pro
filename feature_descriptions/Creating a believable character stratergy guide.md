# Creating a believable character stratergy guide

You're facing two core challenges, which are deeply connected:

1. **Content Authenticity (The "Micro" Problem):** Individual posts, scripts, and captions sound robotic, generic, and lack a unique human voice. They feel like they were written by a machine because they were.
2. **Persona Authenticity (The "Macro" Problem):** The persona's entire existence feels fake because it's one-dimensional. A real person's life isn't just a series of product promotions. Without a "real life," the persona is just a walking advertisement, which audiences can spot immediately.

Solving this requires a two-pronged approach: a strong strategic foundation (the persona's "soul") and sophisticated execution (the persona's "voice").

Here is a strategic framework to solve both problems.

### Step 1: Build the "Persona Bible" - The Foundation of Authenticity

Before you write a single line of content, you need to define the persona in extreme detail. This document, your "Persona Bible," will be the source of truth you feed to the AI for every single task.

**A. Core Identity:**

- **Name:** E.g., An Nhiên, Minh Khôi.
- **Age & Demographics:** 24 years old, lives in District 2, Ho Chi Minh City.
- **Occupation:** Freelance graphic designer (this allows for flexible hours and a creative lifestyle).
- **Backstory:** Grew up in Da Lat, moved to HCMC for university, loves the city's energy but misses nature.

**B. Personality & Voice:**

- **Myers-Briggs/Enneagram (Optional but helpful):** E.g., INFP, Type 4 - The Individualist. This helps define their motivations.
- **Communication Style:** Witty and a bit sarcastic, but also empathetic. Uses modern slang (`"cháy"`, `"u là trời"`) but not excessively. Prefers writing in shorter, punchier sentences. Uses specific emojis frequently (e.g., 🌱, ☕️, 🫠).
- **Quirks & Imperfections:** Is terrible at cooking, always has a messy desk, is obsessed with finding the best Phở in the city, sometimes posts at 2 AM because of a burst of inspiration. *Imperfections are what make a character feel human.*

**C. The Brand Relationship (The Crucial Link):**

- **How did they discover your brand?** "I was looking for a sustainable skincare brand (brand value) and stumbled upon them..."
- **Why do they *genuinely* love it?** Connect this to their backstory and values. "Coming from Da Lat, I've always valued natural ingredients. This brand's commitment to that (brand mission) really resonates with me."
- **How does it fit into their life?** It's not the center of their life. It's the tool that helps them achieve something. E.g., "Their energy drink helps me power through late-night design projects."

**D. Life Beyond the Brand:**

- **Hobbies & Interests:** Film photography, tending to their collection of houseplants, exploring hidden cafes, loves indie music.
- **Values:** Sustainability, creative expression, work-life balance, supporting local businesses.
- **Daily Routine:** Wakes up late, waters plants, works from a cafe in the afternoon, meets friends in the evening.

### Step 2: The Content Strategy - Weaving a Believable Life

Your persona's content should be a mix of activities, not just selling. Use a content pillar strategy. For every 10 posts, you might have:

- **4 x Lifestyle/Value Posts:** Content related to their hobbies and values that *align with the brand* but don't mention the product.
    - **Example (for a sustainable brand):** An Nhiên posts a photo of her visiting a local "refill" store. Caption: "Trying to reduce my plastic waste, one jar at a time! 🌱 Any other great refill spots in Saigon I should check out?"
- **3 x Community Engagement Posts:** Content that builds a relationship with the audience.
    - **Example:** A poll on Instagram Stories: "Creative block is real today 🫠. Coffee or a walk in the park to fix it?" Or a post asking for cafe recommendations.
- **2 x "Soft" Product Integration Posts:** The product is visible or mentioned, but it's not the hero of the story.
    - **Example:** A "day in my life" video. The brand's product is seen on her desk, and she uses it naturally without a big sales pitch.
- **1 x "Hard" Product Promotion Post:** A direct review, tutorial, or announcement (the KOC part).
    - **Example:** "Okay, a lot of you have been asking about my skincare routine. Let's talk about this serum from [Brand Name] that has been a lifesaver..."

### Step 3: Curing the "AI Voice" - Advanced Prompting for Execution

Now that you have the "Persona Bible" and a content strategy, you can generate content that sounds human. Never use a simple prompt like "Write a post about our new product."

**Instead, use a layered, role-playing prompt:**

> "You are An Nhiên, a 24-year-old freelance graphic designer from Da Lat living in HCMC. Your personality is witty, a bit sarcastic, but kind. You love houseplants, indie music, and sustainability. Your writing style is conversational, using short sentences and modern slang like 'u là trời'. You frequently use these emojis: 🌱, ☕️, 🫠.
> 
> 
> **CONTEXT:** Today is a rainy Monday in Saigon. You're feeling a bit unmotivated and are working from your apartment. Your desk is a little messy.
> 
> **TASK:** Write an Instagram caption for a photo of you at your desk, holding a cup of coffee. The new energy drink from [Brand Name] is also visible on your desk. This is a 'soft integration' post. You need to talk about Monday motivation in a relatable way, briefly mentioning how the drink is helping you get started.
> 
> **DO NOT:**
> 
> - Use overly formal or corporate language.
> - Sound like a generic advertisement.
> - List the product ingredients or benefits.
> - Use hashtags like #ad or #sponsored in the main body of the text."

**For video/voice scripts, add another layer:**

> "...In the script, include natural pauses, filler words like 'umm' or 'you know', and one moment where you laugh at yourself for being messy. The tone should be like you're on a casual video call with a friend."
> 

By giving the AI a **role**, **context**, a **detailed voice**, and **negative constraints**, you force it to break out of its generic patterns and write in character. The final, and most important part, is that a **human must always review and slightly edit the output** to add the final touch of nuance.
