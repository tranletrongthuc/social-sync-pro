# Corrected Sidebar Width Inconsistency Analysis

**Date:** 2025-09-29

## 1. The Issue

The user observed that on desktop, the sidebar in the "Content Strategy" tab correctly occupies 50% of the screen width, while the sidebar in the "Media Plan" tab incorrectly expands to take up more than 50% of the screen. A re-review of the latest code was requested to confirm the cause.

## 2. Corrected Analysis

After re-reading the latest versions of `ContentStrategyPage.tsx` and `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx`, the root cause has been confirmed. The issue stems from a subtle difference in the HTML structure of the flexbox container in `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx`.

### Correct Implementation (`ContentStrategyPage.tsx`)

This component uses a clean, two-child flex container:

```jsx
// In ContentStrategyPage.tsx

<div className="h-full flex flex-col md:flex-row bg-gray-50/50">
  {/* Child 1 */}
  <NavigationSidebar ... />

  {/* Child 2 */}
  <MainContentArea ... />
</div>
```

- **Behavior:** The `md:flex-row` class correctly arranges its two direct children side-by-side on desktop. The sidebar (`NavigationSidebar`) takes its `md:w-1/2` width, and the main content (`MainContentArea`, which has `flex-1`) correctly fills the remaining space.

### Problematic Implementation (`MediaPlanDisplay.tsx`)

This component has an extra `div` wrapping its main content, resulting in a nested structure that breaks the flexbox calculation:

```jsx
// In MediaPlanDisplay.tsx

<div className="h-full flex flex-col md:flex-row bg-gray-50/50">
  {/* Child 1 */}
  <MediaPlanSidebar ... />

  {/* Child 2 - An extra wrapper div */}
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
    <MediaPlanMainContent ... />
  </div>
</div>
```

- **Behavior:** The `md:flex-row` is applied to the container, but its second child is a `div` with `flex-1`, not the `MediaPlanMainContent` component directly. This extra layer in the DOM tree disrupts the intended layout, causing the `MediaPlanSidebar` to not be constrained correctly.

## 3. Conclusion

The inconsistent behavior is caused by the unnecessary wrapping `div` around the `<MediaPlanMainContent />` component in `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx`. This extra structural layer interferes with the parent flexbox container's layout calculations.

**Recommended Fix:** Refactor `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx` to remove the extra `div`. The `<MediaPlanMainContent />` component should be a direct child of the main flex container, identical to the structure in `ContentStrategyPage.tsx`.
