# Sidebar Width Inconsistency Analysis

**Date:** 2025-09-29

## 1. The Issue

The user observed that on desktop, the sidebar in the "Content Strategy" tab correctly occupies 50% of the screen width, while the sidebar in the "Media Plan" tab incorrectly expands to take up more than 50% of the screen, despite the components appearing structurally similar.

## 2. Analysis

The root cause of this inconsistency is not within the sidebar components themselves, but in the immediate parent `div` that acts as a flex container for the sidebar and the main content area in each respective tab.

### Correct Implementation (`ContentStrategyPage.tsx`)

This component correctly uses explicit responsive classes to define its layout:

```jsx
// In ContentStrategyPage.tsx

<div className="h-full flex flex-col md:flex-row bg-gray-50/50">
  <NavigationSidebar ... />
  <MainContentArea ... />
</div>
```

- **Key Class:** `flex-col md:flex-row`
- **Behavior:** This class instructs the layout to stack its children vertically by default (mobile-first) and switch to a side-by-side row layout on medium screens and larger (`md:` breakpoint). When in the row layout, the sidebar's `md:w-1/2` class is respected, and the main content's `flex-1` class correctly fills the remaining space.

### Problematic Implementation (`MediaPlanDisplay.tsx`)

This component uses a slightly different and less explicit set of classes for its container:

```jsx
// In MediaPlanDisplay.tsx

<div className="h-full flex flex-1 overflow-hidden">
  <MediaPlanSidebar ... />
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
    <MediaPlanMainContent ... />
  </div>
</div>
```

- **Key Difference:** This container is missing the explicit `md:flex-row` class and instead has a `flex-1` class.
- **Behavior:** The `flex-1` on the container itself likely causes it to compete for space within its own parent, leading to unpredictable sizing of its children. Without the explicit `md:flex-row` directive, the responsive layout behavior is not as robust, causing the sidebar to ignore its `md:w-1/2` constraint on desktop.

## 3. Conclusion

The inconsistent behavior is caused by `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx` lacking the explicit `md:flex-row` class and having an unnecessary `flex-1` class on its main flex container. The layout in `ContentStrategyPage.tsx` is the correct implementation.

**Recommended Fix:** Refactor the container `div` in `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx` to use the same responsive classes as `ContentStrategyPage.tsx` to ensure consistent desktop layout behavior.
