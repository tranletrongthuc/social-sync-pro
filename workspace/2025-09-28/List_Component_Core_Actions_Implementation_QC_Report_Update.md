## Overall Assessment

The developer has done an excellent job implementing the QC report requirements. The UI is now much more consistent, maintainable, and professional-looking. The remaining inconsistencies are minor and do not significantly impact the user experience.

## Recommendations

1. Consider creating a standardized `ActionToolbar` component for complete header button consistency
2. Address remaining text wrapping edge cases
3. Standardize refresh button implementations across all components

## Implementation Status: 95% Complete

Ready for production with minor polish opportunities remaining.
