## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

-   **Security:** All API keys and sensitive credentials must be stored securely on the backend (BFF) and never exposed to the client.

-   **Usability:** The user interface must be intuitive and guide the user through the complex workflow of content creation, from idea to publication.
-   **Reliability:** The application should have robust error handling and provide clear feedback to the user when an operation fails.
