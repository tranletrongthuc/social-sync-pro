# End-to-End (E2E) Testing Strategy for SocialSync Pro

This document outlines a comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) testing strategy for the SocialSync Pro application. The goal is to simulate real user journeys to ensure all components work together as expected, providing a reliable and bug-free user experience.

    *   Set the `baseURL` to the local development server's address.
    *   Configure browser targets (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
    *   Enable trace recording (`on-first-retry`) for easier debugging of failed tests.
*   **Test Directory:** Create a top-level `e2e` directory to house all E2E test files.
