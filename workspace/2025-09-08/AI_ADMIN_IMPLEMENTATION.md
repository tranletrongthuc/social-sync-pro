# AI Services Administration Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a comprehensive admin panel for managing AI services and their supported models with persistent storage in Airtable.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- Added `AI_Services` table with fields:
  - `service_id` (Primary Key)
  - `name`
  - `description`
- Added `AI_Models` table with fields:
  - `model_id` (Primary Key)
  - `name`
  - `provider`
  - `capabilities` (Multiple Select)
  - `service` (Linked Record to AI_Services)

### 2. Admin Panel (AdminPage.tsx)
- Full CRUD operations for AI services and models
- Sample data loading functionality
- Airtable integration for persistent storage
- Responsive UI with editing capabilities
- Error handling and loading states

### 3. Airtable Service Integration
- Added `saveAIService` function to create/update AI services
- Added `deleteAIService` function to remove AI services and their associated models
- Added `saveAIModel` function to create/update AI models
- Added `deleteAIModel` function to remove AI models
- Added `loadAIServices` function to retrieve all AI services with their models

### 4. Settings Integration
- Updated SettingsModal to dynamically load AI models from Airtable
- Enhanced model selection dropdowns with custom AI service models
- Maintained backward compatibility with default models

## Technical Details

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface AIModel {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  provider: string;
  capabilities: string[];
}

interface AIService {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  models: AIModel[];
}
```

### API Functions
- `saveAIService(service, brandId)` - Creates or updates an AI service
- `deleteAIService(serviceId, brandId)` - Deletes an AI service and all its models
- `saveAIModel(model, serviceId)` - Creates or updates an AI model
- `deleteAIModel(modelId)` - Deletes an AI model
- `loadAIServices(brandId)` - Loads all AI services with their models

## Usage
1. Navigate to `/admin` in the application
2. Log in with the configured admin password
3. Add new AI services and models using the forms
4. Load sample data to quickly populate with common providers
5. Models are automatically available in the Settings panel for selection

## Future Improvements
- Add pagination for large datasets
- Implement search and filtering capabilities
- Add bulk import/export functionality
- Enhance error handling with user-friendly messages
- Add validation for duplicate service/model names
