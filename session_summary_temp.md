## Session Summary (2025-09-20)

This session focused on fixing a series of UI feedback and data flow bugs, primarily centered around loading states and asynchronous operations in the Affiliate Vault and Content Strategy tabs.

### 1. Summary of Accomplishments

*   **Fixed Unresponsive "Import from File" Button:** Resolved an issue where the "Nhập từ tệp" button in the Affiliate Vault was not working. The fix involved adding a hidden `<input type="file">` element to the `AffiliateVaultDisplay.tsx` component and connecting it to the existing click handler and file processing logic.

*   **Fixed Imported Data Persistence:** Addressed a bug where affiliate links imported from a file were correctly displayed in the UI but not saved to the database. The `handleImportAffiliateLinks` function in the `useStrategyManagement.ts` hook was updated to correctly call the database service to persist the links. The corresponding reducer logic in `assetsReducer.ts` was also improved to handle bulk additions and updates correctly, ensuring the UI refreshes with the saved data.

*   **Fixed "Generate Ideas from Product" Workflow:** Resolved a multi-part bug in this feature:
    *   **Data Parsing Crash:** Corrected a data parsing error in `response.processor.ts`. The `processIdeasFromProductResponse` function was updated to handle cases where the AI wraps the response in a `{"ProductIdeas": [...]}` object instead of returning a direct array.
    *   **UI Feedback:** Replaced a generic, misleading full-screen loading overlay with a specific loading spinner on the individual `ProductCard` button that was clicked. This was achieved by refactoring the loading state management.
    *   **Stuck Spinner After Navigation:** Fixed a bug where a spinner would get stuck on the Content Strategy page after generating ideas and being redirected. 

*   **Refactored Loading State Management:** The root cause of several UI bugs (wrong spinner, stuck spinner) was a single generic `isLoading` flag in `useStrategyManagement.ts`. This was refactored into multiple, specific loading state flags (`isGeneratingIdeas`, `generatingIdeasForProductId`, `isSelectingTrend`, `isSuggestingTrends`, `isSaving`). This new, granular state was then propagated through the component tree (`App.tsx` -> `MainDisplay.tsx` -> `ContentStrategyPage.tsx` / `AffiliateVaultDisplay.tsx`), making the UI feedback accurate and eliminating state conflicts.

### 2. Issues to Note

*   **Generic Loading Anti-Pattern:** The session highlighted a recurring issue where a single `isLoading` flag for a hook/component that performs multiple different async actions can lead to confusing UI feedback or race conditions. The refactoring to specific flags (`isSaving`, `isGenerating`, etc.) is a robust pattern that should be preferred.
*   **Inconsistent AI Response Structures:** The AI has shown a tendency to wrap arrays in objects (e.g., `{"ProductIdeas": [...]}` vs. `[...]`). Response processing functions must be written defensively to check for and handle these structural variations to prevent crashes.

### 3. Uncompleted Tasks

*   None. All identified issues were resolved during this session.

### 4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions

*   **Use Specific Loading States:** For any hook or component with more than one asynchronous action, use separate, descriptively named loading state variables (e.g., `isFetching`, `isSaving`) instead of a single generic `isLoading` flag.
*   **Write Defensive Parsers:** When processing data from an external API, especially an AI, anticipate variations in the response structure. Write parsers that check for multiple possible keys or data structures and handle them gracefully.
*   **Trace Prop-Drilling for State:** When debugging UI state, always trace the state prop from its origin (e.g., the hook where `useState` is called) all the way down the component tree to the component where it's being used. This helps identify if the wrong state is being passed or if it's being overwritten.
