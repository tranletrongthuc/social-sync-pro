Here is a comprehensive summary of the content in `session_summary.md` from the beginning up to **2025-09-12**, preserving all original technical details and structure beyond that date.

---

### **1. Summary (From Start to 2025-09-12)**

This period reflects an intensive phase of architectural refactoring, debugging, and feature implementation across both frontend and backend layers of the **SocialSync Pro** application. The work was structured around improving code maintainability, fixing critical bugs, enhancing AI-driven features, and ensuring robust deployment on Vercel.

#### **Key Achievements & Technical Workflows**

##### **API Layer Refactoring**
- **Route Consolidation**: To comply with Vercel Hobby plan limits, all API routes under `/api` were consolidated into single files per service (`mongodb.js`, `gemini.js`, `openrouter.js`). These use query parameters like `?action=generate-in-character-post` to differentiate operations.
- **Backend Data Models Updated**:
  - Modified `api/mongodb.js` to stop copying full `adminSettings` when creating a new brand. New brands now initialize with minimal settings containing only `prompts.rules`.
  - Extended the `Settings` interface in `types.ts` to include nested prompt structures: `AutoGeneratePersonaPrompts`, `GenerateInCharacterPostPrompts`, `MediaPlanGenerationPrompts`, `SimplePrompts`, and `ContentPackagePrompts`.

##### **Frontend Architecture Refactoring**
- **`App.tsx` Monolith Decomposition**:
  - Extracted logical domains into dedicated custom hooks:
    - `usePersonaManagement`
    - `useMediaPlanManagement`
    - `useAssetManagement`
    - `useStrategyManagement`
    - `useSchedulingManagement`
    - `useProjectIO`
  - Goal: Transform `App.tsx` into a lean orchestrator component managing state flow between modular hooks.
- A detailed plan for this refactoring was documented in `feature_descriptions/App_Refactoring_Plan.md`, following the 5W1H framework.

##### **Service Layer Standardization**
- Introduced **BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) abstraction**:
  - Centralized API access via `bffService.ts`.
  - Implemented standardized fetching using `bffFetch` helper with consistent headers and error handling.
  - Exported service-specific wrappers such as:
    - `generateContentWithBff` (for Gemini)
    - `publishToFacebookWithBff` (for Facebook)

##### **AI Prompt System Overhaul**
- **Prompt Builder Refactoring**:
  - Created a modular `PromptBuilder` class system supporting dynamic rule-based generation.
  - Supported components: Image Prompt, Short/Long Video Script, Post Caption — each configurable via user-defined rules.
  - Planning documents updated:
    - `Prompt_Builder_Refactoring_Solution_Plan.md`
    - `Prompt_Builder_Refactoring_Implementation_Plan.md`
- **Enhanced Content Generation Logic**:
  - Backend (`api/gemini.js`) enhanced to accept `keywords` parameter in `generate-in-character-post`.
  - Propagated `keywords` through service layer (`bffService.ts`, `geminiService.ts`).
- **Fixed "N/A" in Image Prompts**: Removed redundant/faulty template in `src/services/geminiService.ts` causing `"N/A"` prefix when no persona existed.

##### **Dynamic Opt-in Settings Implementation**
- Implemented a **"Dynamic Opt-in Settings"** system allowing client brands to selectively adopt updated global admin defaults.
- Ensures backward compatibility while enabling incremental rollout of prompt/template changes.

##### **Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements**
- **Build Errors Resolved**:
  - Numerous TypeScript compilation errors fixed due to prior incomplete refactors.
  - Fixed duplicate declaration of `isSettingsModalOpen` in `App.tsx`.
  - Corrected hook dependency chain between `useAutoSave` and `useProjectIO`, particularly around `syncLastSaved`.
- **Double Auto-Save Bug Fixed**:
  - Prevented duplicate `create-or-update-brand` calls by calling `syncLastSaved()` after initial manual creation.
- **Carousel Feature Deep Refactor**:
  - Fixed race conditions in concurrent image generation; changed “Generate All” to sequential processing.
  - Resolved MongoDB array update conflicts by switching from full array replacement to individual element updates.
  - Built reusable `Carousel` component in `src/components/ui.tsx`.
  - Updated `PostDetailModal.tsx` and `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx` to support carousel display via `CarouselPostHandler` and pass `imageUrls` correctly.
- **Image Upload & Persistence Bugs Fixed**:
  - Enabled image pasting in modals by adding proper event handlers.
  - Fixed bug where `logoConcept` image URLs weren’t saved to MongoDB.
- **Airtable Deprecation Completed**:
  - Fully migrated from Airtable to MongoDB.
  - Removed: `DatabaseLoadModal.tsx`, related state/hooks in `App.tsx`, and `airtable` npm package.

##### **UI/UX Enhancements**
- **Mobile Responsiveness**:
  - Implemented mobile-first design.
  - Added mobile menu toggle.
  - Made header action buttons responsive.
  - Removed tab icons for cleaner UI.
- **Content Strategy Tab Redesign**:
  - Standardized layout and improved loading states.
  - Fixed display bug in content strategy ideas section.
  - Enhanced metadata enrichment and persistence.

##### **Authentication & Session Management**
- Improved auth resilience:
  - Test edge cases: expired tokens, invalid passwords, page reloads.
  - Ensure logout controls are present.
  - Use `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` for session-persistent state.

##### **Deployment & Performance Optimization**
- Diagnosed 45+ second LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):
  - Root causes: Sequential startup API calls and large JS bundle.
  - Solution explored: Consider preloading core reference data (personas, affiliate links) at project load instead of lazy-loading per tab.
- OpenRouter Limitations Noted:
  - Does not support: content package generation, Facebook trend generation, in-character post generation → explicit fallback errors implemented.

##### **Error Handling & Debugging Improvements**
- Enhanced response processing:
  - Added logging for AI response parsing steps.
  - Improved regex extraction debugging.
  - Created unit tests for `sanitizeAndParseJson` with varied formats.
- Robust error inspection:
  - Catch blocks now inspect full string representation of errors (not just `.message`) due to BFF-wrapped exceptions.
- Non-blocking toast notifications added when `ensureMongoProject` returns `null` (e.g., missing DB credentials).

##### **TypeScript & Build Integrity Enforcement**
- Large-scale effort to restore build stability:
  - Used `npx tsc --noEmit` after every file change to catch type errors early.
  - Addressed cascading type mismatches, signature inconsistencies, and missing properties.
  - Verified fixes incrementally and prioritized core data-flow blocking issues.

### **2. Issues to Note (Potential Bugs or Errors)**

| Issue | Risk | Context |
|------|------|--------|
| **Incomplete Mobile Testing** | Medium | Responsive design implemented but not thoroughly tested across devices/orientations. May lead to layout overflow or interaction issues. |
| **Potential UI Overflow in Tabs** | Low-Medium | Tabbed sections (especially Content Strategy) may have scrolling problems on smaller screens. Requires viewport testing. |
| **Missing Error Handling in Components** | High | Some components lack robust handling for network failures or AI timeouts. Could result in silent failures or crashes. |
| **Hardcoded Model References** | Medium | Incomplete fix noted; some models may still be hardcoded despite refactoring intent. Need audit. |
| **Lazy Loading Causing Downstream Bugs** | High | Lazy-loading `affiliateLinks` caused dependent components to fail. Suggest loading all project-scoped reference data upfront. |
| **Regex Extraction Fragility** | Medium | Regex used in AI response parsing can break with minor formatting changes. Needs more resilient patterns or schema validation. |
| **ID Field Confusion** | High | Dual use of `id` (MongoDB `_id`) vs `productId` (affiliate platform). Misuse could cause data mismatches. Logging recommended. |
| **Unreliable Replace Tool Usage** | Critical (Process Risk) | Use of automated `replace` led to syntax corruption due to whitespace/newline sensitivity. Abandoned in favor of read-modify-write. |

---

### **3. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions**

To prevent recurrence of systemic issues and improve development reliability, the following practices will be strictly enforced:

| Measure | Description |
|-------|-----------|
| ✅ **Strict Workflow Adherence** | Follow all 7 steps of the defined workflow without exception or shortcuts. |
| ✅ **Mandatory `npx tsc --noEmit` After Every Change** | Run immediately after any file modification to detect type/syntax issues early. |
| ✅ **Abandon `replace` for Complex Changes** | For multi-line or structural changes, use **read-modify-write** pattern: read entire file → modify in memory → overwrite with `write_file`. Avoid brittle string matching. |
| ✅ **Immediate Build Verification** | After every `write_file`, run `npm run build` to verify syntactic and type correctness before proceeding. |
| ✅ **Review Context Before Editing** | Examine imports and surrounding logic to avoid reintroducing old bugs or breaking dependencies. |
| ✅ **Test Edge Cases** | Always test authentication flows with expired tokens, invalid inputs, and page refreshes. |
| ✅ **Validate External Data** | Thoroughly validate templates with placeholders (e.g., `{{variable}}`) to ensure substitution integrity. |
| ✅ **Break Down Complex Features** | Avoid monolithic implementations (e.g., content package prompts); decompose into smaller, testable units. |
| ✅ **Provide User Controls** | Ensure UI includes appropriate actions (e.g., logout) for state-changing features. |
| ✅ **Clear Communication of Limitations** | Explicitly inform user when a tool cannot reliably perform a task (e.g., OpenRouter limitations), and suggest manual alternatives. |
| ✅ **Maintain Planning Documents** | Keep `*.md` plans (e.g., refactoring blueprints) updated to reflect current architecture and implementation status. |

Additionally:
- **Log ID fields** when passing objects between functions to prevent `id` vs `productId` confusion.
- **Preload core project data** rather than relying on fragile lazy-loading strategies that break dependent components.

Session Summary (2025-09-13) [1]
---

### 1. Summary of Accomplishments

This session involved extensive debugging, refactoring, and addressing multiple critical bugs across the application's frontend and backend.

*   **Carousel Display Implementation:**
    *   A reusable `Carousel` React component was created in `src/components/ui.tsx`.
    *   `PostDetailModal.tsx` was refactored to use `CarouselPostHandler` for carousel content types, displaying images in a slide format.
    *   `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx` was updated to correctly pass an array of image URLs (`imageUrls`) to `PostCard` for carousel posts.
    *   `PostCard.tsx` was updated to accept `imageUrls` and render the `Carousel` component for `Carousel Post` content types.
*   **Image Paste Functionality Restored:**
    *   A visible paste area with `onPaste` event handling was added to `ImagePostHandler` in `PostDetailModal.tsx` for single image posts.
    *   Similar paste functionality was added for individual image prompts within `CarouselPostHandler`.
*   **AI Model Routing Fixes:**
    *   The `getProviderService` function in `src/services/textGenerationService.ts` was made more robust to correctly route requests for OpenRouter models (e.g., `meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct:free`) to the `/api/openrouter/generate` endpoint, preventing incorrect calls to `/api/gemini/generate`.
    *   A syntax error in `src/services/configService.ts` related to provider string comparison was fixed.
*   **OpenRouter API Response Handling:**
    *   The backend `api/openrouter.js` was made more resilient to empty or invalid JSON responses from the external OpenRouter API. The `generate` and `generate-image` actions now robustly handle non-JSON or empty responses, preventing server crashes and returning meaningful errors to the frontend.
*   **Type Error Resolution:**
    *   A persistent `TS2345` type error in `src/hooks/usePersonaManagement.ts` was resolved by modifying the `savePersonaToDatabase` function in `src/services/databaseService.ts` to correctly accept `Partial<Persona>` objects.
    *   A syntax error in `src/components/ui.tsx` (duplicate `);`) was identified and fixed.
    *   A syntax error in `src/services/prompt.builder.ts` was identified and fixed (user assisted).
*   **Video Post `mediaPrompt` Fix (Initiated):**
    *   The `buildMediaPlanPrompt` function in `src/services/prompt.builder.ts` was updated to include instructions for the AI to generate a `mediaPrompt` (script prompt) for `Video Post`, `Shorts`, and `Reel` content types, even if no specific rules are defined.

### 2. Issues to Note

*   **Modal Not Opening for Posts with Images (Recurring Bug):** Despite multiple attempts and adding logging, the `PostDetailModal` still fails to open for posts that have an image. This is the primary blocking issue. The root cause is still unknown.
    *   **User's Manual Change:** The user manually removed the `h-full` class from `PostDetailModal.tsx`. It is unclear if this resolved the bug or introduced new layout issues.
*   **Carousel Image Data Storage (Ongoing):** The fundamental issue of storing multiple image URLs for `Carousel Post`s in the backend is still being addressed. The `imageUrl` field in the database is currently a single string, not an array, for these posts.
    *   The `imageUrlsArray` field was added to `MediaPlanPost` in `types.ts`.
    *   The backend `api/mongodb.js` (`save-media-plan-group` action) is currently being modified to correctly save multiple image URLs into this new field.
*   **`PostCard.tsx` Logging Issue:** Unable to add logging to `PostCard.tsx` due to file truncation issues with the `read_file` tool, hindering debugging efforts for the post feed display.
*   **`mediaPrompt` for Video Posts:** The fix for this was implemented in `prompt.builder.ts`, but the user needs to regenerate their media plan to see the effect.

### 3. Uncompleted Tasks

*   **Carousel Image Data Storage (Backend `save-media-plan-group`):** The modification of `api/mongodb.js` to correctly save `imageUrlsArray` for `Carousel Post`s is in progress.
*   **Carousel Image Data Loading (Backend `load-media-plan`):** The `api/mongodb.js` `load-media-plan` action needs to be updated to retrieve `imageUrlsArray` and populate the `generatedImages` cache for carousel posts.
*   **Frontend Image Saving for Carousel Posts:** `useAssetManagement.ts` (`onSetImage`) and `databaseService.ts` (`updateMediaPlanPostInDatabase`) need to be updated to handle saving multiple image URLs for carousel posts.
*   **Debugging Modal Not Opening:** This task is ongoing and requires console logs from the user.

### 4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions

To ensure a more efficient and error-free workflow, the following measures will be strictly adhered to:

*   **Strict Workflow Adherence:** All 7 steps of the defined workflow will be followed precisely for every task, without exception or shortcuts.
*   **Mandatory `npx tsc --noEmit`:** This command will be run *after every single file modification* to immediately catch type and syntax errors.
*   **Read-Modify-Write for Complex Changes:** The `replace` tool will only be used for the most simple, single-line, unambiguous changes. For all other modifications, the full read-modify-write pattern will be used: `read_file` to get the exact content, perform changes in memory, and then `write_file` to overwrite the original. This will prevent `replace` tool failures and syntax errors.
*   **Thorough Pre-Coding Analysis:** Before writing any code, a more explicit and detailed analysis (Step 2 of the workflow) will be performed to check for existing imports, props, and component structure to avoid conflicts and ensure changes integrate seamlessly.
*   **Targeted Debugging with User Collaboration:** When a bug is not immediately apparent from static analysis, targeted logging will be added, and the user will be explicitly asked to provide the console output to pinpoint the exact cause.

### Session Summary (2025-09-13) [2]

This session was dedicated to a deep, end-to-end refactoring of the "Carousel Post" feature, followed by fixing several related UI bugs that were uncovered through rigorous testing and user feedback.

---

### 1. Summary of Accomplishments

*   **End-to-End Carousel Refactoring:** A complete overhaul of the carousel feature was performed across the entire stack.
    *   **Data Model:** The `MediaPlanPost` type in `types.ts` was updated to properly support carousels by adding an `imageKeys: string[]` field to correspond with the existing `imageUrlsArray: string[]`.
    *   **Backend (`api/mongodb.js`):** The `save-media-plan-group`, `update-media-plan-post`, and `load-media-plan` actions were all refactored to correctly persist and retrieve the new `imageKeys` and `imageUrlsArray` fields, ensuring data integrity for multi-image posts.
    *   **Frontend State & Services:** The `assetsReducer` and `databaseService` were updated to handle indexed array updates for carousels. The `useAssetManagement` hook was significantly refactored, making the `handleSetImage` function "carousel-aware" by allowing it to accept an index to update a specific slide.
    *   **UI Implementation:** The `PostCard` and `PostDetailModal` components were fixed to correctly render the `<Carousel />` component for posts with the `'Carousel'` content type.

*   **AI Response Normalization (Root Cause Fix):**
    *   **Problem:** It was discovered that the AI was returning a wide variety of `contentType` strings (e.g., `album`, `imageCarousel`, `reel`, `story`) that did not match the application's strict internal types.
    *   **Solution:** A `normalizeContentType` function was implemented in the `response.processor.ts` file. This function intercepts the AI response and maps all variations to the correct, standardized types (`'Carousel'`, `'Reel'`, etc.) before the data enters the main application state. This fixed numerous downstream UI bugs at their source.

*   **UI/UX Refinements:**
    *   **Prompt Display:** Fixed a bug where an array of `mediaPrompt` strings was being incorrectly displayed as a single, comma-separated line. The `ImagePostHandler` and `VideoPostHandler` were refactored to loop over the array and display each prompt individually.
    *   **Individual Prompt Copying:** As a follow-up, the UI was enhanced to wrap each individual prompt in the list with its own "copy-to-clipboard" feature.
    *   **Carousel Editor Redesign:** Based on user feedback and a provided diagram, the `CarouselPostHandler` was redesigned to feature a persistent "Paste Area" for each prompt, improving the workflow for updating individual carousel slides.

### 2. Issues to Note

*   **Critical Environment/Caching Issue:** The most significant issue during the session was the user's local environment not reflecting code changes. Multiple correct fixes were implemented but did not appear for the user, leading to repeated bug reports for already-fixed issues. This was diagnosed as a browser or development server caching problem that requires manual intervention from the user (a hard reload or server restart) to resolve. My initial diagnoses were incorrect, and I was not firm enough in insisting on this environmental fix.
*   **My Own Incomplete Analysis:** My initial fixes were not thorough enough. I failed to initially consider the full range of `contentType` values the AI could return, and I did not verify how every UI component would render an array of `mediaPrompt` strings. This led to a frustrating cycle of follow-up bugs that could have been prevented with a more holistic initial analysis.

### 3. Uncompleted Tasks

*   None. All technical tasks for this session were completed. The final remaining action is for the user to clear their environment's cache to see the latest correct version of the application.

### 4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions

*   **Forceful Environment Check:** If a user reports that a fix is not working, and the evidence (e.g., screenshots) points to old code, I must immediately and firmly halt further code changes and insist on environment-clearing steps (hard reload, server restart). I should provide the user with a method to verify they have the new code (e.g., "look for this specific line of code in your browser's sources tab").
*   **Holistic Impact Analysis:** When a data structure from an external source (like an AI response) changes, I must perform a more rigorous analysis of the entire data flow to find and fix all downstream impacts in a single, comprehensive operation.
*   **Verify UI Rendering:** When fixing data logic, I must always follow up by manually tracing how that data is consumed and rendered by all relevant UI components.

## Session Summary (September 13, 2025) [3]

### Summary of Accomplishments

This session focused on fixing critical issues with carousel image generation and display:

1. **Fixed Carousel Image Generation Race Condition**:
   - Identified and resolved race conditions in concurrent carousel image generation
   - Modified the "Generate All" button to generate images sequentially instead of concurrently
   - Improved client-side state management to ensure proper data flow

2. **Fixed MongoDB Array Update Conflicts**:
   - Resolved MongoDB errors when updating carousel image arrays
   - Implemented individual array element updates instead of full array replacements
   - Eliminated conflicts between individual element and full array updates

3. **Enhanced Error Handling and Robustness**:
   - Added better error handling in asset management hooks
   - Improved state management to use current data instead of potentially stale data
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging purposes

### Key Technical Changes

1. **PostDetailModal.tsx**:
   - Changed `handleGenerateAll` to generate images sequentially
   - Added proper useCallback import for React hooks

2. **useAssetManagement.ts**:
   - Improved carousel image update logic to use current state data
   - Added better error handling and logging
   - Enhanced state updates to prevent race conditions

3. **mongodb.js**:
   - Fixed MongoDB update operations to avoid field conflicts
   - Changed array updates to use individual element updates only
   - Removed conflicting full array updates

### Issues to Note

1. **UI Feed Refresh Issue**: While database updates are working correctly, the main post feed is not automatically refreshing to show newly generated images. This suggests the issue might be in how the application state is propagated to the feed components.

2. **Potential State Management Issues**: There might be additional state management issues in how the main application state is updated and propagated to all components after database updates.

### Uncompleted Tasks

1. **Post Feed Refresh**: The main task of ensuring the post feed refreshes with new images after generation is still incomplete. The database is correctly updated, but the UI feed is not reflecting these changes.

### Preventative Measures for Future Sessions

1. **Sequential Processing**: For operations that modify shared state, prefer sequential processing over concurrent operations to avoid race conditions.

2. **Database Update Patterns**: When updating arrays in MongoDB, use individual element updates rather than full array replacements to avoid conflicts.

3. **State Propagation**: Ensure that database updates properly propagate to all relevant UI components through proper state management patterns.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Always test both database updates and UI refreshes to ensure end-to-end functionality works correctly.

# Session Summary (2025-09-14) [1]

# Session Summary (2025-09-14) [2]

## 1. Summary of Accomplishments

This session focused on implementing the Content Strategy tab redesign and fixing several critical bugs in the AI response processing system.

### Content Strategy Tab Redesign
- **Component Restructuring**: Refactored the monolithic StrategyDisplay component into a modern two-section layout:
  - `NavigationSidebar.tsx`: Collapsible sidebar containing trends list, search/filter functionality, and suggestion tools
  - `MainContentArea.tsx`: Main content area with tabbed interface for trend details
  - Child components: `TrendListItem.tsx`, `OverviewTab.tsx`, `RelatedQueriesTab.tsx`, `SourcesTab.tsx`
- **Performance Optimizations**: 
  - Implemented lazy loading for tab content using React.lazy/Suspense
  - Added memoization for frequently rendered components
  - Implemented input debouncing for search functionality (300ms delay)
- **UI/UX Improvements**: 
  - Created enhanced trend metadata display with visual indicators
  - Implemented stats dashboard with card-based layout
  - Made sidebar collapsible for focus mode
  - Added proper mobile responsiveness with overlay sidebar

### Bug Fixes
1. **Viral Ideas Generation**: Fixed the `processViralIdeasResponse` function to properly handle AI responses wrapped in markdown code blocks and extract the `ViralIdeas` array from the response object.

2. **Content Package Generation**: Fixed the `processContentPackageResponse` function to handle both `repurposedContent` (singular) and `repurposedContents` (plural) keys from AI responses, and made it more robust by logging warnings instead of throwing errors when repurposed content is missing.

3. **Prompt Builder Refactoring**: Refactored the prompt builder system to eliminate code duplication by creating dedicated helper functions for rule application:
   - `buildImagePromptRules()`, `buildCarouselPromptRules()`, `buildShortVideoScriptRules()`, etc.
   - Applied brand-specific image prompt rules (including the 8 key factors for realistic AI photos) to content package generation

4. **Brand Settings Integration**: Ensured that brand-specific settings rules are properly applied to all generated content, including:
   - Image prompt rules with 8 key factors for realistic AI photos
   - Short/long video script rules
   - Post caption rules

## 2. Issues to Note

1. **Potential UI Overflow**: The tabbed details section in the Content Strategy tab may still have scrolling issues on some screen sizes. Need to verify that all content fits properly within the viewport.

2. **Missing Error Handling**: The error handling in some components could be more robust, particularly for network failures and AI service timeouts.

3. **Incomplete Mobile Testing**: While mobile responsiveness was implemented, thorough testing across various device sizes and orientations has not been completed.

## 3. Uncompleted Tasks

1. **Comprehensive Mobile Testing**: While the mobile layout has been improved, testing across various device sizes and orientations is still needed.

2. **Accessibility Audit**: A full accessibility audit of the new UI components has not been completed.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimization of the trend list rendering with virtualization may be needed for large datasets.

## 4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions

1. **Follow Component Architecture**: Continue using the modular component structure with proper separation of concerns (NavigationSidebar + MainContentArea).

2. **Reuse Helper Functions**: Always use the dedicated helper functions for rule application in the prompt builder to avoid code duplication.

3. **Implement Performance Optimizations**: Continue using lazy loading, memoization, and debouncing for performance-critical components.

4. **Maintain Brand Settings Integration**: Ensure all AI-generated content properly applies brand-specific rules and settings.

5. **Thorough Testing**: Always test both desktop and mobile layouts after major UI changes.

6. **Type Safety**: Ensure all new data fields are properly added to both frontend types and backend database schemas.

7. **Progressive Enhancement**: When adding new features, ensure they enhance existing functionality rather than replacing it entirely.

8. **Data Persistence Verification**: Always verify that new data fields are properly saved to and retrieved from the database.

9. **Cross-Device Consistency**: Maintain consistent user experience and functionality across all device sizes after UI changes.

## 5. Technical Debt Addressed

1. **Code Duplication**: Eliminated repeated rule construction logic in the prompt builder by creating dedicated helper functions.

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Made error handling more consistent across AI response processors.

3. **Missing Brand Settings Integration**: Ensured brand-specific rules are properly applied to all AI-generated content.

4. **UI Standardization**: Replaced inconsistent layout with a clean, standardized design following modern UI/UX principles.

4. Continue refining mobile experience based on real-world usage

# Session Summary (2025-09-18) [2]

## 1. Summary of Accomplishments

This session focused on implementing a comprehensive background task processing system to eliminate the frozen screen issue during long-running generative operations. The implementation enables users to initiate tasks and continue using the application while tasks are processed asynchronously in the background.

### Key Technical Implementation:

1. **Backend API (`/api/jobs.js`)**
   - Created RESTful endpoint with actions: `create`, `process`, `status`, `cancel`
   - Implemented MongoDB persistence for task tracking with comprehensive schema
   - Added rate limiting (1 task/minute per user) and security validation
   - Designed task types: `GENERATE_MEDIA_PLAN`, `GENERATE_BRAND_KIT`, `AUTO_GENERATE_PERSONAS`, `GENERATE_VIRAL_IDEAS`, etc.

2. **Frontend Integration**
   - Updated all generative hooks (`useMediaPlanManagement`, `useStrategyManagement`) to create background tasks
   - Implemented `taskService` with centralized API communication
   - Added `useTaskPolling` hook with exponential backoff polling (1.5^attempt, capped at 30s)
   - Created global `TaskContext` for state management across components

3. **UI Components**
   - Added `TaskStatusIndicator` floating panel showing active tasks
   - Implemented `TaskNotification` for task completion alerts
   - Integrated visual progress tracking with status indicators

4. **Payload Optimization**
   - Fixed critical issue with oversized payloads by extracting only necessary fields
   - Reduced payload sizes from 35KB+ to a few hundred bytes
   - Eliminated circular references and memory issues

### Critical Bug Fixes:
1. **TypeScript Syntax Error**: Converted all `.js` files to remove TypeScript annotations (`: string`, `: boolean`, etc.)
2. **JSON Parsing Error**: Fixed error response formatting to prevent "Unexpected token ':'" errors
3. **Large Payload Issue**: Optimized task payloads to prevent server overload

## 2. Issues to Note

| Issue | Risk | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Incomplete Task Processing** | High | Backend `/api/jobs?action=process` only simulates work with `setTimeout()` rather than calling actual generative services |
| **Missing Task Types** | Medium | Not all task types (e.g., `GENERATE_FUNNEL_CAMPAIGN`, `GENERATE_CONTENT_PACKAGE`) have corresponding processing logic |
| **QStash Integration Not Tested** | Medium | Implementation assumes QStash webhook delivery but lacks real-world testing |
| **Payload Serialization** | Low-Medium | Some complex objects might still cause serialization issues if not properly handled |

## 3. Uncompleted Tasks

1. **Actual Task Processing Implementation** - Backend currently simulates work with `setTimeout()` instead of calling real generative services like `textGenerationService.generateMediaPlanGroup()`
2. **Complete Task Type Coverage** - Missing implementation for `GENERATE_FUNNEL_CAMPAIGN`, `GENERATE_CONTENT_PACKAGE`, `GENERATE_FACEBOOK_TRENDS`, etc.
3. **QStash Webhook Integration** - Implementation designed for QStash but requires actual deployment and webhook URL configuration
4. **WebSocket Real-time Updates** - Currently using polling; planned upgrade to WebSocket for real-time notifications
5. **Task Result Persistence** - Generated content needs proper saving to database when tasks complete

## 4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions

1. **Payload Size Monitoring** - Always check `Content-Length` headers to ensure payloads remain manageable (<1KB for task creation)
2. **Serialization Testing** - Verify objects sent in payloads don't contain circular references or excessively nested structures
3. **TypeScript Compliance** - Ensure `.js` files don't contain TypeScript syntax annotations
4. **Error Response Formatting** - Always validate API error responses are properly escaped JSON
5. **Task Payload Isolation** - Extract only necessary fields rather than sending entire objects in task payloads
6. **Comprehensive Logging** - Maintain consistent `[BackgroundTask]`, `[API/Jobs]`, `[TaskService]` prefixes for easy debugging
7. **Rate Limit Awareness** - Remember 1 task/minute/user rate limiting when testing multiple tasks

## 5. Next Steps

1. Implement actual generative service calls in `/api/jobs?action=process` handler
2. Complete all task type processing logic (brand kits, personas, content packages, etc.)
3. Configure and test with real QStash webhooks for production deployment
4. Add WebSocket integration for real-time task updates
5. Implement task result persistence and database saving
6. Add comprehensive task history and management UI

## Session Summary (2025-09-20) [1]

This session focused on fixing a series of UI feedback and data flow bugs, primarily centered around loading states and asynchronous operations in the Affiliate Vault and Content Strategy tabs.

### 1. Summary of Accomplishments

*   **Fixed Unresponsive "Import from File" Button:** Resolved an issue where the "Nhập từ tệp" button in the Affiliate Vault was not working. The fix involved adding a hidden `<input type="file">` element to the `AffiliateVaultDisplay.tsx` component and connecting it to the existing click handler and file processing logic.

*   **Fixed Imported Data Persistence:** Addressed a bug where affiliate links imported from a file were correctly displayed in the UI but not saved to the database. The `handleImportAffiliateLinks` function in the `useStrategyManagement.ts` hook was updated to correctly call the database service to persist the links. The corresponding reducer logic in `assetsReducer.ts` was also improved to handle bulk additions and updates correctly, ensuring the UI refreshes with the saved data.

*   **Fixed "Generate Ideas from Product" Workflow:** Resolved a multi-part bug in this feature:
    *   **Data Parsing Crash:** Corrected a data parsing error in `response.processor.ts`. The `processIdeasFromProductResponse` function was updated to handle cases where the AI wraps the response in a `{"ProductIdeas": [...]}` object instead of returning a direct array.
    *   **UI Feedback:** Replaced a generic, misleading full-screen loading overlay with a specific loading spinner on the individual `ProductCard` button that was clicked. This was achieved by refactoring the loading state management.
    *   **Stuck Spinner After Navigation:** Fixed a bug where a spinner would get stuck on the Content Strategy page after generating ideas and being redirected. 

*   **Refactored Loading State Management:** The root cause of several UI bugs (wrong spinner, stuck spinner) was a single generic `isLoading` flag in `useStrategyManagement.ts`. This was refactored into multiple, specific loading state flags (`isGeneratingIdeas`, `generatingIdeasForProductId`, `isSelectingTrend`, `isSuggestingTrends`, `isSaving`). This new, granular state was then propagated through the component tree (`App.tsx` -> `MainDisplay.tsx` -> `ContentStrategyPage.tsx` / `AffiliateVaultDisplay.tsx`), making the UI feedback accurate and eliminating state conflicts.

### 2. Issues to Note

*   **Generic Loading Anti-Pattern:** The session highlighted a recurring issue where a single `isLoading` flag for a hook/component that performs multiple different async actions can lead to confusing UI feedback or race conditions. The refactoring to specific flags (`isSaving`, `isGenerating`, etc.) is a robust pattern that should be preferred.
*   **Inconsistent AI Response Structures:** The AI has shown a tendency to wrap arrays in objects (e.g., `{"ProductIdeas": [...]}` vs. `[...]`). Response processing functions must be written defensively to check for and handle these structural variations to prevent crashes.

### 3. Uncompleted Tasks

*   None. All identified issues were resolved during this session.

### 4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions

*   **Use Specific Loading States:** For any hook or component with more than one asynchronous action, use separate, descriptively named loading state variables (e.g., `isFetching`, `isSaving`) instead of a single generic `isLoading` flag.
*   **Write Defensive Parsers:** When processing data from an external API, especially an AI, anticipate variations in the response structure. Write parsers that check for multiple possible keys or data structures and handle them gracefully.
*   **Trace Prop-Drilling for State:** When debugging UI state, always trace the state prop from its origin (e.g., the hook where `useState` is called) all the way down the component tree to the component where it's being used. This helps identify if the wrong state is being passed or if it's being overwritten.

# Session Summary (2025-09-22) [1]
### **1. Summary of Accomplishments**

This session focused on resolving critical application startup errors, refactoring UI components for better state management, and significantly advancing the background task processing feature.

*   **Resolved Application Startup Error (`ReferenceError`):** Fixed `ReferenceError: setLoaderContent is not defined` in `src/hooks/useStrategyManagement.ts`. This involved replacing calls to an undefined global loader with specific loading state setters (`setIsGeneratingIdeas`, `setGeneratingIdeasForProductId`, `setIsSuggestingTrends`) and cleaning up `useCallback` dependencies.
*   **Fixed Cascading Type Errors:** The initial fix led to subsequent TypeScript errors in `src/App.tsx` and `src/components/MainDisplay.tsx`.
    *   Removed a redundant, obsolete `handleSuggestTrends` function from `src/App.tsx`.
    *   Updated prop passing to `MainDisplay` in `src/App.tsx` to correctly include `isGeneratingIdeas` and `isSelectingTrend` from the `strategyManager` hook.
    *   Renamed `isGeneratingStrategyIdeas` to `isGeneratingIdeas` in `src/components/MainDisplay.tsx` for consistency.
    *   Replaced a generic `isLoading` prop with specific loading state props (`isSelectingTrend`, `isSuggestingTrends`, `isGeneratingIdeas`) in the `ContentStrategyPage` invocation within `src/components/MainDisplay.tsx`.
    *   Corrected a corrupted prop name (`onClearSelection onOpenScheduleModal`) and an incorrect function reference (`onOpenFunnelWizard`) in `src/components/MainDisplay.tsx`.
*   **Removed Obsolete Prop Chain:** Identified and removed the unused `onGenerateFacebookTrends` / `isGeneratingTrendsFromSearch` prop chain from `src/components/content-strategy/NavigationSidebar.tsx`, `src/components/ContentStrategyPage.tsx`, and `src/components/MainDisplay.tsx`, as the associated feature was no longer in use.
*   **Implemented Task Manager Tab:**
    *   **Backend API:** Added a new `action=list` endpoint to `api/jobs.js` to allow fetching all tasks for a given `brandId` from MongoDB.
    *   **Frontend Services:** Added a `listTasks` function to `src/services/taskService.ts` to interact with the new backend endpoint.
    *   **Frontend UI:** Created a new `src/components/TaskManagerDisplay.tsx` component to display the task list. Integrated this component by updating `src/components/Header.tsx` to include a "Task Manager" tab and modifying `src/App.tsx` and `src/components/MainDisplay.tsx` to manage its state and rendering.
*   **Converted Backend Modules to ES Modules:** Resolved `Error: The requested module ... does not provide an export named ...` by converting several `server_lib` files from CommonJS (`module.exports`) to ES module (`import`/`export`) syntax:
    *   `server_lib/generationService.js`
    *   `server_lib/promptBuilder.js`
    *   `server_lib/responseProcessor.js`
    *   `server_lib/aiService.js`
    *   `server_lib/geminiClient.js`
    *   `server_lib/openrouterClient.js`
*   **Implemented Actual Task Processing for `GENERATE_MEDIA_PLAN`:**
    *   **Refactoring:** Moved core prompt building, response processing, and AI service orchestration logic from frontend `src/services` into the new `server_lib` modules (`promptBuilder.js`, `responseProcessor.js`, `aiService.js`, `geminiClient.js`, `openrouterClient.js`, `generationService.js`).
    *   **Integration:** Updated `api/jobs.js` to call `generateMediaPlanGroup` from `server_lib/generationService.js` for `GENERATE_MEDIA_PLAN` tasks, replacing the previous mock `setTimeout` logic.
*   **Enabled Automatic Task Triggering (Self-Invocation):** To ensure background tasks are processed immediately for development/testing without QStash:
    *   Modified `api/jobs.js` to self-invoke the `process` action from within the `createTask` function using an internal `fetch` call. This allows `createTask` to return quickly while processing occurs asynchronously.
*   **Resolved SSL/TLS Error during Self-Invocation:** Fixed `FetchError: request to https://localhost:3000/... failed, reason: wrong version number` by changing the `baseUrl` for local development in `api/jobs.js` from `https://localhost:3000` to `http://localhost:3000`.

### **2. Issues to Note**

*   **QStash Integration (Uncompleted):** The system is designed for QStash webhook delivery but still lacks real-world testing and full integration. The current self-invocation is a development workaround.
*   **WebSocket Real-time Updates (Uncompleted):** The planned upgrade to WebSocket for real-time notifications is still pending.
*   **Task Result Persistence (Partial):** While `GENERATE_MEDIA_PLAN` now saves its result, other task types (`GENERATE_BRAND_KIT`, `AUTO_GENERATE_PERSONAS`, etc.) still use mock `setTimeout` logic in `api/jobs.js` and do not persist real results.
*   **Other Task Types (Uncompleted):** Only `GENERATE_MEDIA_PLAN` has been fully implemented with real processing logic. Other task types in `api/jobs.js` still use mock data.
*   **Frontend `src/services` cleanup:** The original `src/services/prompt.builder.ts`, `src/services/response.processor.ts`, `src/services/textGenerationService.ts`, and `src/services/utils.ts` still exist. While the backend now uses the `server_lib` versions, the frontend might still be using the `src/services` versions, leading to potential duplication or inconsistencies if not managed.

### **3. Uncompleted Tasks**

*   **QStash Integration:** Full integration and testing of QStash for robust task queuing and delivery.
*   **WebSocket Real-time Updates:** Implement WebSocket for real-time task status updates to replace polling.
*   **Task Result Persistence for other types:** Extend the actual processing and result saving for `GENERATE_BRAND_KIT`, `AUTO_GENERATE_PERSONAS`, `GENERATE_CONTENT_PACKAGE`, `GENERATE_FUNNEL_CAMPAIGN`, `GENERATE_VIRAL_IDEAS`, `GENERATE_FACEBOOK_TRENDS`, `GENERATE_TRENDS`, `GENERATE_GLOBAL_TRENDS`, and `GENERATE_IDEAS_FROM_PRODUCT`.
*   **Complete Task Type Coverage:** Implement the full processing logic for all defined `TaskType`s in `api/jobs.js`.
*   **Frontend Service Refactoring:** Refactor `src/services` to use the new `server_lib` modules where appropriate, or to remove redundant logic.

### **4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions**

*   **Strict Adherence to Module Systems:** Maintain consistency in module import/export (`import`/`export` vs `require`/`module.exports`) across frontend and backend, especially in shared `server_lib` code.
*   **Clear Separation of Frontend/Backend Logic:** Continue to move core business logic to `server_lib` for reusability in API routes and background tasks.
*   **Thorough Testing of Internal API Calls:** When implementing self-invocation or internal API calls, pay close attention to protocol (`http`/`https`), host, and port to avoid connectivity issues.
*   **Incremental Implementation of Background Tasks:** Continue implementing other task types in `api/jobs.js` one by one, following the pattern established for `GENERATE_MEDIA_PLAN`.
*   **Frontend Service Refactoring:** Plan to refactor the frontend `src/services` to import from the new `server_lib` where appropriate, or to remove redundant logic.

# Session Summary (2025-09-22) [2]

### **1. Summary of Accomplishments**

This session involved significant refactoring across the full stack to improve data synchronization and address several critical bugs.

*   **Backend Refactoring (Idea Count):** Modified `api/mongodb.js` (`load-strategy-hub` action) to implement server-side aggregation. This now correctly calculates and includes the `ideaCount` for each `Trend` object returned, improving data loading efficiency.
*   **Frontend Refactoring (Idea Count Display):** Updated `types.ts` to include the `ideaCount` field in the `Trend` type. `TrendListItem.tsx` was refactored to directly display `trend.ideaCount`. The redundant `ideas` prop and client-side calculation logic were removed from `App.tsx`, `MainDisplay.tsx`, `ContentStrategyPage.tsx`, and `NavigationSidebar.tsx` to streamline the frontend data flow.
*   **Task Management Centralization:** The `TaskContext.tsx` was refactored to become the single source of truth for the task list. It now manages the `taskList` state (`taskList`, `isLoadingTasks`) and provides a `loadTasks` function to fetch the latest tasks from the database.
*   **Task Refresh Mechanism:**
    *   `App.tsx` was updated to consume task state directly from `useTaskManager` and to pass a new `refreshAllData` callback (renamed from `onTaskCreated`) to relevant hooks.
    *   `useMediaPlanManagement.ts` and `useStrategyManagement.ts` were modified to call `refreshAllData()` after successfully creating a background task, ensuring the Task Manager tab automatically updates.
*   **Media Plan Data Loading:** Added `onLoadMediaPlanData` to `useMediaPlanManagement.ts` to fetch media plan groups, and `listMediaPlanGroups` to `taskService.ts` to support this new loading function.

*   **Bug Fixes:**
    *   **SSL Error (Self-invocation):** Resolved `FetchError: wrong version number` during self-invocation of background tasks by implementing a robust environment check in `api/jobs.js` using `process.env.VERCEL_ENV` to correctly determine `http` vs `https` protocols.
    *   **"Invalid Signature" Error:** Fixed by adding an `isSelfInvoke: true` flag to self-invoked task requests and modifying `api/jobs.js` to bypass QStash signature validation when this flag is present.
    *   **`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'tone')`:** Corrected by fixing the destructuring of `generationOptions` in `server_lib/promptBuilder.js` (`buildMediaPlanPrompt` function).
    *   **Media Plan Post Storage:** Corrected `generateMediaPlanGroup` in `server_lib/generationService.js` to properly save high-level media plan data to `mediaPlanGroups` and individual posts to the `mediaPlanPosts` collection, linking them by `mediaPlanId`.
    *   **`brandId` Type Mismatch:** Fixed `brandId` storage in `generateMediaPlanGroup` to be a string, resolving issues with media plans not appearing in the list.

### **2. Issues to Note**

*   **Persistent Caching/Environment Issues:** The most significant recurring problem throughout the session. Despite explicit instructions, the user's environment repeatedly failed to load the latest code, leading to prolonged debugging of already-fixed issues (e.g., `ideaCount: 0` display, `pink border` test). This indicates a fundamental challenge in ensuring the user's local setup reflects code changes.
*   **`App.tsx` Corruption:** A critical error occurred where `mongoBrandId={mongoBrandId}` was duplicated multiple times in the `<MainDisplay />` invocation within `App.tsx`. This was likely due to an issue with the `replace` tool's behavior when `old_string` was not sufficiently unique or due to repeated attempts to apply the same change. This file requires immediate manual correction.
*   **Unresolved `onLoad...Data` type errors:** While `onLoadTasks` was fixed, other `onLoad...Data` props in `MainDisplayProps` (e.g., `onLoadStrategyHubData`, `onLoadAffiliateVaultData`, `onLoadPersonasData`) are still typed as `() => Promise<void>` but are expected to take `brandId`. This needs to be addressed to fully integrate the `refreshAllData` pattern.

### **3. Uncompleted Tasks**

*   **Fix `App.tsx` Corruption:** The `App.tsx` file currently has duplicate `mongoBrandId` props in the `MainDisplay` invocation. This needs to be manually cleaned up by the model.
*   **Complete `refreshAllData` Integration:**
    *   Update `onLoadStrategyHubData`, `onLoadAffiliateVaultData`, `onLoadPersonasData` prop types in `MainDisplayProps` to accept `brandId`.
    *   Modify `MainDisplay.tsx` to pass `mongoBrandId` to these `onLoad...Data` calls.
*   **KOL/KOC Tab Refresh:** No specific `onLoad...Data` function was identified or implemented for this tab.
*   **Frontend `src/services` cleanup:** The original `src/services/prompt.builder.ts`, `src/services/response.processor.ts`, `src/services/textGenerationService.ts`, and `src/services/utils.ts` still exist. While the backend now uses the `server_lib` versions, the frontend might still be using the `src/services` versions, leading to potential duplication or inconsistencies if not managed.

### **4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions**

*   **Strict Environment Control:** User *must* ensure their development environment is fully updated (server restart, hard refresh) before reporting persistent issues. The model should explicitly ask for confirmation of this.
*   **Atomic `write_file` for large changes:** For complex refactors, prefer `write_file` for entire functions/components over multiple `replace` calls to prevent partial updates and corruption.
*   **Pre-check `old_string` uniqueness:** Before using `replace`, perform a `search_file_content` for the `old_string` to ensure it's truly unique and avoid unintended multiple replacements.
*   **Defensive Coding for `process.env`:** Be extremely cautious when relying on `process.env` variables for environment detection; prefer explicit Vercel environment variables (`VERCEL_ENV`) or clear configuration.
*   **Comprehensive Type Checking:** Run `npx tsc --noEmit` frequently and address all errors immediately.
*   **Full Data Flow Tracing:** Before implementing features, trace the entire data flow from backend to frontend to ensure all necessary data is available at each component level.

# Session Summary (2025-09-23) [1]

### **1. Summary of Accomplishments**

This session focused on a major refactoring of the brand creation workflow and continued resolution of TypeScript errors.

*   **Brand Creation Flow Refactoring:**
    *   **Architectural Decision:** Consolidated the `generateBrandProfile` and `generateBrandKit` steps into a single, asynchronous background task named `CREATE_BRAND_FROM_IDEA`. This improves user experience by preventing UI freezes and simplifies the data flow.
    *   **Backend Implementation:**
        *   Updated `src/types/task.types.ts` to include the new `CREATE_BRAND_FROM_IDEA` task type and removed the redundant `GENERATE_BRAND_PROFILE`.
        *   Modified `api/jobs.js` to allow the `brandId` to be optional when creating a `CREATE_BRAND_FROM_IDEA` task, addressing the "chicken-and-egg" problem of brand ID availability.
        *   Refactored the core brand creation database logic from `/api/mongodb.js` into a reusable `createOrUpdateBrand` function within `server_lib/mongodb.js`.
        *   Created a new `createBrandFromIdea` function in `server_lib/generationService.js`. This function orchestrates the entire brand creation process: it calls `generateBrandProfile`, then `generateBrandKit`, and finally saves the complete `GeneratedAssets` to the database using the new `createOrUpdateBrand` function.
        *   Updated `api/jobs.js` to import and utilize the `createBrandFromIdea` function for the `CREATE_BRAND_FROM_IDEA` task type.
        *   Moved `buildBrandKitPrompt` and `buildGenerateBrandProfilePrompt` from `src/services/prompt.builder.ts` to `server_lib/promptBuilder.js`, along with their associated JSON structures.
        *   Moved `processBrandKitResponse` and `processBrandProfileResponse` from `src/services/response.processor.ts` to `server_lib/responseProcessor.js`.
    *   **Frontend Implementation:**
        *   Replaced the old, synchronous `handleGenerateProfile` and `handleGenerateKit` functions in `App.tsx` with a single `handleCreateBrandFromIdea` function. This new function now initiates the `CREATE_BRAND_FROM_IDEA` background task via `taskService`.
        *   Updated the `IdeaProfiler` component to call `handleCreateBrandFromIdea`.
        *   Removed the intermediate "profile" step and the `BrandProfiler` component from the initial brand creation flow in `App.tsx`.
        *   Removed the `textGenerationService` import from `App.tsx` as it is no longer directly used for brand creation.

*   **TypeScript Error Resolution (In Progress):**
    *   **`App.tsx` `refreshAllData` dependency cycle:** Identified and began addressing a complex dependency cycle where `refreshAllData` and several manager hooks (`personaManager`, `mediaPlanManager`, `strategyManager`) mutually depended on each other. The chosen solution is to replace the `refreshAllData` prop in the hooks with a more generic `onTaskCreated` callback.
    *   **Hooks Refactoring:**
        *   `useMediaPlanManagement.ts`: Refactored to use `onTaskCreated` instead of `refreshAllData` in its interface, function signature, and internal calls. Also fixed a destructuring error in `onLoadMediaPlanData`.
        *   `useStrategyManagement.ts`: Refactored to use `onTaskCreated` instead of `refreshAllData` in its interface, function signature, and internal calls.
        *   `usePersonaManagement.ts`: Refactored to use `onTaskCreated` instead of `refreshAllData` in its interface, function signature, and internal calls.
    *   **`MainDisplay.tsx` and Child Components (`ContentStrategyPage`, `AffiliateVaultDisplay`, `PersonasDisplay`) Prop Drilling:**
        *   Updated `ContentStrategyPage.tsx`, `AffiliateVaultDisplay.tsx`, and `PersonasDisplay.tsx` to accept `mongoBrandId` as a prop and to use it when calling their respective `onLoadData` functions.
        *   Updated `MainDisplay.tsx` to pass the `mongoBrandId` prop to these child components.

### **2. Issues to Note**

*   **Persistent `App.tsx` Refactoring Challenges:** The final step of refactoring `App.tsx` to fully implement the `onTaskCreated` callback pattern (i.e., removing the `refreshAllData` function and passing `onTaskCreated` to the hooks) has proven challenging due to the `replace` tool's sensitivity to changing code context. This has resulted in repeated "old_string not found" errors, preventing atomic application of the necessary changes.
*   **QStash SDK Not Installed:** The `npm install @upstash/qstash` command was not executed by the user. This is a pending prerequisite for full QStash integration.
*   **Remaining TypeScript Errors:** Despite significant progress, the last `tsc --noEmit` run still reported errors, primarily related to the incomplete `App.tsx` refactoring and potential lingering type mismatches from the `refreshAllData` to `onTaskCreated` transition.

### **3. Uncompleted Tasks**

*   **Complete `App.tsx` Refactoring for `onTaskCreated`:** The final modification to `App.tsx` to fully remove the `refreshAllData` function and correctly pass the `onTaskCreated` callback to all relevant hooks is still pending. This is the primary blocker for resolving the remaining TypeScript errors.
*   **Install QStash SDK:** The `npm install @upstash/qstash` command needs to be executed by the user.
*   **Full QStash Integration:** The complete integration of QStash (modifying `api/jobs.js` to publish to QStash, setting up environment variables, and configuring webhooks) is still pending.

### **4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions**

*   **Break Down Complex `replace` Operations:** For multi-line or context-sensitive code changes, especially in large files like `App.tsx`, prioritize using the `read_file` tool to fetch the current content, perform the modifications in memory, and then use `write_file` to overwrite the entire section or file. This avoids the brittleness of `replace` when the `old_string` context changes.
*   **User Confirmation for `npm install`:** Explicitly confirm that `npm install` commands are executed by the user before proceeding with dependent code changes.
*   **Incremental Verification:** After each significant code modification, run `npx tsc --noEmit` to catch and address type errors immediately, rather than accumulating them.

# Session Summary (2025-09-23) [2]

### **1. Summary of Accomplishments**

This session was an extensive debugging and refactoring effort focused on stabilizing the application, fixing critical errors, and making the local development environment functional.

*   **TypeScript Error Resolution:** Successfully resolved all outstanding TypeScript errors. This involved a deep analysis of multiple hooks (`usePersonaManagement`, `useMediaPlanManagement`, `useAssetManagement`, `useStrategyManagement`) and components (`App.tsx`, `MainDisplay.tsx`, `ContentStrategyPage.tsx`) to synchronize their props and function signatures.

*   **Infinite Loop Fix:** Diagnosed and fixed a critical infinite render loop in `App.tsx`. The root cause was an unstable `settings` object being recreated on every render. The fix was to memoize the object using the `useMemo` hook, which stabilized the application's state updates.

*   **Backend API `405` Error Fix:** Resolved the `HTTP 405: Method Not Allowed` error by rewriting the main request handler in `api/mongodb.js`. The original code incorrectly blocked all non-`POST` requests; the fix introduced a whitelist to correctly handle `GET` requests for read-only actions.

*   **Local Development Environment Troubleshooting & Final Solution:**
    *   Attempted to fully integrate QStash for background task processing, including installing the SDK and modifying `api/jobs.js`.
    *   Encountered a persistent `invalid destination url: endpoint resolves to a loopback address` error, indicating a local network/DNS configuration issue on the user's machine that prevented `ngrok` and the `qstash-cli` from working correctly.
    *   After exhausting all webhook-based solutions, the final, successful solution was to **revert `api/jobs.js` to a self-invocation model**. This approach uses a background `fetch` call to `localhost`, bypassing the need for public tunnels and unblocking local development, while still working correctly in the Vercel production environment.

### **2. Issues to Note**

*   **User's Local Network Environment:** The most significant issue was an unresolvable problem with the user's local machine configuration. It incorrectly resolves public tunneling domains (from `ngrok` and `qstash-cli`) to a loopback address (`localhost`). This is a fundamental blocker for any local development workflow that relies on public webhooks.
*   **Development Server Caching:** The `vercel dev` server repeatedly served stale versions of `api/mongodb.js`, which significantly delayed debugging the `405` error. This required multiple explicit instructions to the user to fully stop and restart the server to clear the cache.

### **3. Uncompleted Tasks**

*   None. All technical objectives for this session were completed, culminating in a stable, working local development environment using the self-invocation pattern for background tasks.

### **4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions**

*   **Forceful File Overwrites:** For complex or critical file changes where `replace` has failed or might be ambiguous, use a full `read-modify-write_file` cycle to guarantee the change is applied atomically. This was the key to fixing the `405` error.
*   **Assume Caching First:** If a logical fix does not work, the primary suspect should be server-side caching. The first debugging step should be to give the user explicit and firm instructions to **completely stop and restart** the development server.
*   **Isolate Environment vs. Code Bugs:** When an error seems illogical (like the loopback issue), add targeted `console.log` statements to definitively prove what values the code is seeing. This is the fastest way to distinguish between a code bug and an environment problem.
*   **Use Self-Invocation as a Fallback:** The self-invocation pattern for background tasks is a robust fallback for local development when webhook-based methods fail due to environmental issues.

# Session Summary (2025-09-24) [1]

## 1. Summary of Accomplishments

This session focused on completing the QStash integration for background task processing in the SocialSync Pro application. Key accomplishments include:

* **Complete QStash Integration:** Successfully implemented full QStash integration with proper signature verification for production environments, while maintaining self-invocation for local development.

* **Signature Verification Implementation:**
  * Identified that QStash now uses JWT-based signatures rather than the older hex-based format
  * Implemented JWT signature verification using the `jsonwebtoken` library
  * Added proper handling of URL-safe base64 encoding used by QStash for body hash comparison
  * Used environment-specific configuration to enable QStash in dev only when `USE_QSTASH_IN_DEV=true`

* **Dual Operation Mode:**
  * **Production:** Always uses QStash when deployed to Vercel
  * **Development:** Default behavior uses self-invocation unless `USE_QSTASH_IN_DEV=true` is explicitly set
  * Proper handling of ngrok tunneling for development testing with QStash

* **Error Resolution:**
  * Fixed "Invalid QStash signature" errors by correctly implementing JWT verification
  * Resolved type import issues with the QStash client
  * Fixed signature verification to handle both the JWT authenticity and body integrity checks

## 2. Issues to Note

| Issue | Risk | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **QStash Signature Format Changes** | Medium | Had to iterate through multiple signature verification approaches as QStash has changed from hex-based to JWT-based signatures |
| **Development Environment Complexity** | Low-Medium | The integration has different behaviors for local dev vs production, requiring careful environment management |
| **Dependency on External Service** | Medium | The system now depends on QStash for production background tasks; failures in QStash could impact task processing |

## 3. Uncompleted Tasks

* **No uncompleted tasks** - The QStash integration has been fully implemented with proper signature verification, environment-specific behavior, and error handling.

## 4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions

1. **Environment Configuration:** Always verify environment variables (`USE_QSTASH_IN_DEV`, `QSTASH_BASE_URL`, etc.) before testing background task functionality
2. **Signature Format Awareness:** Be aware that QStash may update signature formats in the future; maintain awareness of the current format
3. **JWT Verification Best Practices:** When implementing JWT verification, always handle both token authenticity and payload integrity separately
4. **Development vs Production Testing:** Test both the self-invocation mode and QStash mode to ensure both environments work correctly
5. **Ngrok Considerations:** For local QStash testing, ensure ngrok tunnel is active and accessible when `USE_QSTASH_IN_DEV=true`

## 5. Technical Details Preserved

* QStash client initialization with `new QStashClient({ currentSigningKey, nextSigningKey, token })`
* JWT signature verification using `jsonwebtoken.verify()` with URL-safe base64 body hash comparison
* Environment detection logic: `process.env.VERCEL_ENV === 'production'` vs `USE_QSTASH_IN_DEV` flag
* Proper handling of both current and next QStash signing keys for seamless key rotation
* Self-invocation fallback for local development when QStash is not enabled
* Integration with existing task management system (`TaskContext`, `taskService.ts`, etc.)


# Session Summary (2025-09-24) [2]

### **1. Summary of Accomplishments**

This session involved extensive debugging and refactoring to stabilize the background task processing system and improve data integrity.

*   **QStash Integration Stabilized:**
    *   Resolved `HTTP 401: Invalid QStash signature` by correctly implementing QStash JWT verification.
    *   Fixed `TypeError: qstashClient.receiver is not a function` by correctly using `Client` for publishing and `Receiver` for verification from the `@upstash/qstash` SDK.
*   **API Request Body Handling Fixed:**
    *   Resolved `HTTP 500: Missing required fields` error caused by the Vercel dev server stripping POST request bodies.
    *   Implemented a robust, event-based stream reader (`req.on('data')`, `req.on('end')`) in `api/index.js` to reliably read raw request bodies after disabling Vercel's default body parser.
    *   Removed a failed query parameter workaround that caused app instability.
    *   Cleaned up redundant `allowCors` wrappers from sub-handlers (`api/jobs.js`, `api/mongodb.js`).
*   **AI Response Robustness Improved:**
    *   Addressed `Failed to parse AI JSON response` errors caused by AI models returning malformed JSON (e.g., unescaped double quotes).
    *   Enhanced the `buildJsonOutputComponent` in `server_lib/promptBuilder.js` with a critical instruction to the AI to properly escape all string values, including double quotes and newlines.
*   **Data Integrity Bugs Fixed:**
    *   Corrected `brandId: null` issue in `Post` objects by ensuring `brandId` from the task document is correctly passed to generation services in `api/jobs.js`.
    *   Fixed `id` vs `_id` mismatch in `Post` objects by generating a single `ObjectId` and using its string representation for the `id` field in `server_lib/generationService.js`.
*   **Refresh Buttons Initiative Started:**
    *   Added `RefreshIcon` to `src/components/icons.tsx`.
    *   Implemented a refresh button on the `ContentStrategyPage.tsx` to reload its data.

### **2. Issues to Note**

*   **Vercel Dev Environment Instability:** The local development environment (likely `vercel dev` combined with `ngrok`) exhibited significant instability, stripping POST request bodies and crashing when certain stream-reading patterns were used. This required multiple iterations of fixes and workarounds.
*   **AI Model JSON Compliance:** AI models do not always strictly adhere to JSON output formats, necessitating robust parsing and explicit prompting instructions.
*   **Prop Drilling for Refresh:** Adding refresh functionality to each tab requires prop drilling the `onLoadData` functions through `App.tsx` and `MainDisplay.tsx` to each display component.

### **3. Uncompleted Tasks**

*   **Add Refresh Buttons to Remaining Tabs:**
    *   `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx` (partially done, prop drilling completed)
    *   `PersonasDisplay.tsx` (in progress, `replace` failed, needs `read/modify/write`)
    *   `AffiliateVaultDisplay.tsx`
    *   `TaskManagerDisplay.tsx`
    *   `AssetDisplay.tsx`

### **4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions**

*   **Prioritize `read/modify/write` for JSX:** For multi-line or context-sensitive JSX modifications, always use the `read_file`, modify in memory, and `write_file` pattern to avoid `replace` tool failures due to exact string matching.
*   **Explicit AI Prompting:** Continue to use highly explicit and critical instructions in AI prompts regarding output format, especially for JSON, to mitigate AI hallucination of invalid characters.
*   **Robust Stream Reading:** When dealing with Node.js request streams in Vercel environments, prefer event-based stream reading (`req.on('data')`, `req.on('end')`) over async iterators (`for await...of`) for greater stability.
*   **Verify Data Propagation:** Always trace critical data (like `brandId`) through the entire backend pipeline to ensure it's correctly passed to all dependent functions.
*   **Clear Error Logging:** Maintain detailed logging at critical points in the request lifecycle to quickly diagnose issues, especially when dealing with environmental or third-party service interactions.

# Session Summary (2025-09-25) [1]

## Summary of Work Completed

This session focused on fixing critical issues in the SocialSync Pro application, particularly around AI model routing, content display, and data loading functionality.

### 1. Refresh Button Implementation Across All Tabs
Successfully added refresh buttons to all main application tabs:
- ✅ Affiliate Vault tab
- ✅ Task Manager tab  
- ✅ Brand Kit tab
- ✅ Media Plan tab
- ✅ Personas (KOL/KOC) tab
- ✅ Content Strategy tab

All refresh buttons now properly call backend APIs to reload fresh data from the database.

### 2. Content Strategy Tab Data Display Fix
Fixed critical issue where Content Strategy tab was not displaying any trends despite data being available in the database:
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect property access in filtering logic (`trend.title` → `trend.topic`, etc.)
- **Solution**: Updated filtering logic to use correct Trend type properties
- **Result**: All 12+ trends now properly displayed with search and type filtering working

### 3. AI Model Routing and Rate Limit Issues
Fixed widespread AI generation failures affecting all text generation models:
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Paid Google Gemini models hitting rate limits (429 Too Many Requests)
  - Free models incorrectly routed based on name heuristics instead of database service field
  - Model `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` being routed to Gemini API instead of OpenRouter
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented database-based model routing using actual `service` field
  - Added model caching to reduce database queries
  - Fixed service-to-provider mapping logic
- **Result**: All AI models now route correctly to their proper API endpoints

### 4. AI Response Parsing and Debugging Enhancements
Enhanced error handling and debugging for AI response processing:
- **Root Cause**: Newer AI models (DeepSeek R1 0528) returning responses with extra text/markdown formatting
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Added automatic debug file generation (`debug_response_*.txt`) when JSON parsing fails
  - Enhanced JSON extraction logic with better brace detection and cleanup
  - Added detailed logging in viral ideas processing
  - Exported `saveDebugResponse()` utility function for manual debugging
- **Result**: Clear visibility into AI response format issues for faster troubleshooting

## Issues to Note

### 1. Network/Fetch Error in Database Service
Currently investigating `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error in database service when loading strategy hub data:
- Likely caused by CORS issues, API endpoint accessibility, or network connectivity
- Need to verify MongoDB API endpoint is running and accessible
- Check if API routes require authentication headers

### 2. Potential React Strict Mode Double Rendering
Some components may experience double API calls due to React Strict Mode in development:
- Observed with KOL/KOC (Personas) tab initial loading
- Implemented loading state flags to prevent concurrent executions
- Issue primarily affects development environment

### 3. TypeScript Interface Mismatches
Several pre-existing TypeScript errors remain in ContentStrategyPage.tsx:
- Properties like `title`, `description`, `type` don't exist on Trend type
- NavigationSidebarProps interface mismatches in component prop passing
- These were not part of the current fixes but need attention

## Uncompleted Tasks

### 1. Database Service Network Error Investigation
Need to complete investigation and fix for `TypeError: Failed to fetch` in databaseService.ts:
- Verify MongoDB API endpoint accessibility
- Check CORS configuration
- Validate required authentication headers
- Test API routes independently

### 2. Complete Testing of All Refresh Functionality
While refresh buttons have been implemented, full end-to-end testing needed:
- Verify all tabs properly refresh with fresh data
- Test refresh during active data loading states
- Confirm error handling during network failures

## Preventative Measures for Future Sessions

### 1. Model Configuration Management
- Always use database `service` field for model routing, not name heuristics
- Regularly monitor API rate limits and rotate models accordingly
- Maintain list of reliable free-tier models as primary options

### 2. AI Response Handling Best Practices
- Implement robust JSON parsing with fallback strategies
- Always save raw AI responses for debugging when parsing fails
- Test with multiple AI model outputs as formats can vary significantly
- Log response lengths and sample content for visibility

### 3. Component Loading State Management
- Implement loading flags to prevent double executions
- Use React refs or cache mechanisms to track already-loaded data
- Separate initial loading functions from refresh functions clearly

### 4. Error Handling and Debugging
- Always save raw error responses to files for complex debugging
- Implement comprehensive logging with context information
- Create utility functions for common debugging tasks
- Test error scenarios specifically, not just happy paths

### 5. Build and Type Safety
- Run `npm run build` after every significant change
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to catch TypeScript errors early
- Address build errors immediately to prevent cascading issues
- Maintain type safety when modifying component interfaces

## Technical Debt to Address

### 1. Pre-existing TypeScript Errors
Several TypeScript errors in ContentStrategyPage.tsx remain unresolved:
- Interface mismatches between components
- Incorrect property access on data types
- Need to align component props with actual interfaces

### 2. Component Structure Improvements
- Consider refactoring deeply nested components for better maintainability
- Improve separation of concerns in large component files
- Implement more consistent error handling patterns across services

## Files Modified in This Session

### Core Functionality Fixes:
1. `src/components/ContentStrategyPage.tsx` - Fixed data display and filtering logic
2. `src/components/MainDisplay.tsx` - Added refresh button props passing

11. `src/components/TaskManagerDisplay.tsx` - Added refresh button
12. `src/components/AssetDisplay.tsx` - Added refresh button
13. `src/components/MediaPlanDisplay.tsx` - Added refresh button

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Database Service Network Error**: Determine root cause of `Failed to fetch` error when loading strategy hub data
2. **Complete Full Testing**: Verify all refresh functionality works end-to-end across all tabs
3. **Address Remaining TypeScript Errors**: Fix interface mismatches in ContentStrategyPage.tsx
4. **Monitor AI Model Performance**: Ensure new routing logic works reliably with various models
5. **Implement Additional Error Recovery**: Add retry mechanisms for transient network failures



# Session Summary (2025-09-26) [1]

## 1. Summary of Accomplishments

This session focused on implementing and fixing the AI model tracking feature and resolving critical backend issues.

### Model Tracking Implementation
- Successfully implemented comprehensive model tracking across the entire stack:
  - Updated TypeScript interfaces in `types.ts` to include `modelUsed` field for all generated content types (MediaPlanPost, MediaPlanGroup, Persona, Trend, Idea)
  - Modified MongoDB API (`api/mongodb.js`) to handle `modelUsed` field in all CRUD operations
  - Enhanced server_lib generation services to capture and store the actual model used during content generation
  - Created reusable `ModelLabel` component in `src/components/ModelLabel.tsx` for consistent UI display
  - Updated UI components to show model information: `PostCard.tsx`, `TrendListItem.tsx`, `PersonasDisplay.tsx`, `OverviewTab.tsx`, `TaskManagerDisplay.tsx`, `TaskStatusIndicator.tsx`, and `PostDetailModal.tsx`
  - Implemented proper task payload updates to include model information in background task processing

### Critical Backend Issue Fixes
- Fixed "Invalid JSON payload received. Unknown name 'isJson' at 'generation_config'" error by updating `server_lib/aiService.js` to only pass the `isJson` parameter to OpenRouter, not Gemini API
- Fixed "ObjectId is not defined" error by properly importing ObjectId from 'mongodb' in `server_lib/mongodb.js`
- Enhanced JSON parsing robustness in `server_lib/responseProcessor.js` to handle AI responses containing "think" blocks and reasoning content

### Model Tracking Improvements
- Ensured the actual model used (not just the primary model) is captured, even when fallback models are used
- Updated `executeGeneration` function to return both the generated content and the actual model used
- Modified generation functions to return both content and modelUsed information
- Updated database operations to properly preserve modelUsed information

## 2. Issues to Note

| Issue | Risk | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **AI Reasoning Content** | Medium-High | Some AI models return responses with "think" blocks or reasoning content before/around the JSON. The responseProcessor now handles this but the AI may occasionally still return malformed content |
| **Model Compatibility** | Medium | Different AI models (Gemini vs OpenRouter) have different parameter requirements. Need to ensure proper parameter passing to each service |
| **Background Task Processing** | Low-Medium | The fallback model information is now properly tracked, but this requires all generation paths to go through the server_lib generation services |

## 3. Uncompleted Tasks

*None*. All critical tasks were completed during this session:
- Model tracking implementation across frontend/backend/database
- Critical backend error fixes
- JSON parsing enhancements
- UI component updates

## 4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions

1. **Model-Specific Parameter Validation**: Always verify that API parameters are appropriate for the specific AI model provider before sending requests
2. **Robust JSON Parsing**: Continue using the enhanced responseProcessor that handles AI reasoning content and multiple JSON extraction strategies
3. **Model Information Tracking**: Always return both the generated content and the actual model used from generation services
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test background task processing with multiple AI models and both successful and failed scenarios
5. **Type Consistency**: Ensure TypeScript interfaces are updated when adding new fields like `modelUsed` across the entire stack
6. **Import Validation**: Ensure all necessary imports (like ObjectId) are included when using database functions
7. **AI Prompt Engineering**: Consider instructing AI models to avoid including reasoning content in JSON responses when possible

## 5. Technical Details Preserved

- **Database Schema Changes**: Added `modelUsed` field to all generated content collections
- **Server-Lib Implementation**: Enhanced generation services to return actual model used
- **Frontend Components**: All UI components now display model information via ModelLabel component
- **Background Task System**: Properly tracks and displays the actual model used even with fallbacks
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced to handle both Gemini and OpenRouter API incompatibilities
- **JSON Parsing**: Improved to handle AI reasoning content and various response formats

## 2. Issues to Note

| Issue | Risk | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Complex regex validation replacement** | Medium | Replacing regex validation with character-by-character validation may miss some edge cases |
| **Trend generation implementation** | Medium | New trend generation functionality needs thorough testing with various AI models |
| **UI truncation of model names** | Low | Truncated model names may cause confusion for users who need to distinguish between similar models |

## 3. Uncompleted Tasks

1. **Complete refactor of all prompt builders and response processors** - Still need to fully migrate all functions from TypeScript files to server_lib and remove duplicates
2. **Testing of new trend generation functionality** - Requires testing with different AI models and data sets
3. **Verification of all background task types** - Need to ensure all task types work correctly after refactoring

## 4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions

1. **Always validate regex patterns** - When using regex, ensure proper escaping and validation to prevent "missing /" errors
2. **Use safer validation methods** - Prefer character-by-character validation over regex for simple pattern matching to avoid runtime errors

## 2. Issues to Note

| Issue | Risk | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **State update timing** | Medium | If database updates fail but UI state is updated, there could be inconsistency |
| **Paste event reliability** | Low | Paste events may still not work consistently in all browsers/environments |
| **Focus management** | Low | Adding focus to div elements might affect keyboard navigation for some users |

## 3. Uncompleted Tasks

1. **Complete testing of paste functionality** - Requires testing across different browsers and operating systems
2. **Verify state consistency under failure conditions** - Need to ensure proper rollback if database updates fail
3. **Performance testing of frequent state updates** - Verify no performance degradation with rapid image updates

## 4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions

1. **Always update both UI state and database** - When modifying data, ensure both local state and database are updated consistently
2. **Make UI elements properly focusable** - For paste functionality, ensure elements can receive focus and paste events
3. **Test cross-browser compatibility** - Verify functionality works across different browsers and platforms
4. **Implement proper error handling** - Add rollback mechanisms when database updates fail
5. **Run build and type checks** - Always verify changes with `npm run build` and `npx tsc --noEmit`

1. **Inconsistent UI updates** - Fixed the disconnect between database updates and UI state updates
2. **Poor paste event handling** - Improved reliability of paste functionality in post editors
3. **Missing user feedback** - Added visual indicators for focused paste areas

## Files Modified in This Session

### UI Fixes:
- `src/components/PostDetailModal.tsx` - Updated paste area focusability and visual feedback
- `src/hooks/useAssetManagement.ts` - Enhanced image upload state management
- `src/reducers/assetsReducer.ts` - Improved state update logic for media plans

# Session Summary (2025-09-26) [1]

### **1. Summary of Accomplishments**

This session focused on a major refactoring effort to transition all generative AI features to an asynchronous background task system, eliminating synchronous calls and cleaning up the codebase.

*   **Elimination of Synchronous Generative Services:**
    *   Removed `src/services/textGenerationService.ts`, `src/services/geminiService.ts`, `src/services/openrouterService.ts`, `src/services/prompt.builder.ts`, `src/services/response.processor.ts`, and `src/services/imageGenerationService.ts`. These files contained synchronous AI generation logic that is now handled by the backend background task system.
*   **Migration of Generative Logic to `server_lib`:**
    *   Moved core image generation logic into new `server_lib/imageService.js` and `server_lib/cloudinaryService.js`.
    *   Integrated `generateInCharacterPost` logic into `server_lib/generationService.js` and `buildGenerateInCharacterPostPrompt` into `server_lib/promptBuilder.js`.
    *   Migrated the `embed` functionality from `api/gemini.js` to a new dedicated serverless function `api/embedding.js`.
*   **Background Task Integration:**
    *   Introduced new task types: `GENERATE_IMAGE` and `GENERATE_IN_CHARACTER_POST` in `src/types/task.types.ts`.
    *   Refactored frontend hooks (`useAssetManagement.ts`) and components (`PostDetailModal.tsx`) to trigger these new background tasks via `taskService.createBackgroundTask`.
    *   Updated backend `api/jobs.js` to process `GENERATE_IMAGE` and `GENERATE_IN_CHARACTER_POST` tasks, orchestrating calls to the new `server_lib` services.
    *   Updated `server_lib/mongodb.js` with `updateMediaPlanPost` and `syncAssetMedia` to support database updates from background tasks.
*   **API Endpoint Cleanup:**
    *   Deleted obsolete BFF API files: `api/gemini.js`, `api/openrouter.js`, and `api/cloudflare.js`, as their functionality is now handled by the background task system or dedicated endpoints.
*   **Language Enforcement in Prompt Builders:**
    *   Added a forceful instruction to all text-generative prompt builders in `server_lib/promptBuilder.js` to ensure AI responses are strictly in the `settings.language`.
*   **Bug Fixes & Type Corrections:**
    *   Resolved multiple TypeScript errors across `App.tsx`, `MainDisplay.tsx`, `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx` related to prop types and `useInfiniteScroll` usage.
    *   Fixed a syntax error (`Unexpected token ''`) in `server_lib/promptBuilder.js` caused by a duplicated function definition.

### **2. Issues to Note**

*   **Incomplete Image Generation Provider Orchestration:** The `server_lib/imageService.js` currently only supports OpenRouter for image generation. The specific logic for Cloudflare and Gemini's image models (which existed in the now-deleted `api/cloudflare.js` and `api/gemini.js`) has not been fully integrated into `server_lib/imageService.js` as a multi-provider orchestrator. This means image generation via Cloudflare or Gemini might not work through the background task system yet.
*   **Placeholder Frontend Functions:**
    *   `onRefinePost` and `onGeneratePrompt` in `PostDetailModal.tsx` are still passed as placeholder functions (`async () => null` or `() => {}`). Their actual AI-driven implementations need to be wired up to background tasks if they are intended to be AI-driven.
    *   `onGenerateAffiliateComment` in `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx` is called, but its implementation in `useSchedulingManagement.ts` is a placeholder.
    *   `onBulkGenerateImages`, `onBulkSuggestPromotions`, `onBulkGenerateComments` are placeholder functions in `MainDisplay.tsx` and `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx`.

### **3. Uncompleted Tasks (due to AI tool quota)**
None. All identified issues were due to implementation mistakes or incomplete refactoring, not AI tool quotas.

### **4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions**
*   **Strict Adherence to Instructions:** I will strictly adhere to your explicit instructions and avoid making assumptions or performing actions beyond the immediate scope of the request. Any proposed deviations or additional "cleanup" will be explicitly presented for your approval.
*   **Robust Verification for JavaScript Files:** I will integrate a linter (e.g., ESLint) or a more comprehensive syntax check for `.js` files into my verification process to catch syntax errors that `tsc` might miss.
*   **Careful Review of Changes:** I will meticulously review the scope and impact of all code modifications before applying them, especially when deleting or significantly altering existing code, to prevent unintended loss of functionality.
*   **Enhanced Output Validation:** I will implement internal checks to prevent garbled or malformed responses from being sent.

- **Type Safety**: Fixed type compatibility issues between React button attributes and custom onClick handlers
- **Component Architecture**: Established proper export structure for design system components
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensured existing components continue to work without requiring immediate refactoring

## 2. Issues to Note

| Issue | Risk | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Partial Implementation** | Medium | Only created the design system foundation; existing components still need to be refactored to use the new standardized components |
| **Import Path Resolution** | Low | Initial build error due to incorrect import path for Button component, resolved by fixing the import statement |
| **Type Compatibility** | Low | TypeScript error with onClick handler types between React button attributes and custom implementation, resolved by updating the type definitions |
| **Component Adoption** | Medium | Team will need training on the new design system and gradual refactoring of existing components will be required |

## 3. Uncompleted Tasks

*None*. The design system implementation was successfully completed with all components building and compiling without errors.

## 4. Preventative Measures for Future Sessions

1. **Gradual Adoption Strategy**: When introducing design systems, create a phased adoption plan that allows existing components to gradually migrate to new standards
2. **Type Compatibility Testing**: Always verify type compatibility between new components and existing implementations, especially with event handlers
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility when updating core components to avoid breaking existing functionality
4. **Documentation First**: Create comprehensive documentation and examples before implementing design system components
5. **Team Training**: Plan for team training sessions when introducing new design systems to ensure proper adoption
6. **Incremental Rollout**: Implement design systems incrementally, starting with non-critical components first

## 5. Technical Debt Addressed

1. **Inconsistent UI Components**: Eliminated the proliferation of different styles for the same component types (buttons, cards, labels, etc.)
2. **Maintenance Overhead**: Reduced complexity of maintaining multiple implementations of similar UI patterns
3. **Developer Experience**: Improved consistency and predictability of UI components across the application
4. **Accessibility Standards**: Established baseline accessibility requirements through standardized components
