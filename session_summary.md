### 1. Summary of Accomplishments

Over this session, we have performed a significant refactoring of the project's backend API and frontend services with the following key achievements:

*   **API Route Consolidation**	To stay within the Vercel Hobby plan limits, all API routes under the `/api` directory were consolidated. Instead of multiple files, we now have one file per service (`mongodb.js`, `gemini.js`, `openrouter.js`, etc.) that uses an `?action=` query parameter to differentiate between operations.
*   **Database ID Refactoring**	The MongoDB save/update logic in `api/mongodb.js` was refactored to ensure that a custom `id` field (stored as a string) is always created and aligned with the value of the native `_id` (ObjectID). This creates a consistent and predictable ID structure across all collections.
*   **Database Service Consolidation**	All frontend database service logic, which was previously split between `databaseService.ts` and `mongodbStrategyService.ts`, has been merged into a single, comprehensive `databaseService.ts` file for improved maintainability.
*   **Code Cleanup**	All old, redundant API and service files have been deleted, leaving a much cleaner and more organized project structure.

### 3. Key File Contents

The provided code consists of three main files that handle server-side logic and API interactions for a web application.

---

### `/api/mongodb.js`

This file is a **Node.js API endpoint** for a MongoDB database. It functions as a single entry point for all database operations, using a `switch` statement based on a query parameter called `action`. This central handler architecture consolidates data access logic.

Key functionalities include:

* **Data Management:** Operations to save, load, update, and delete records across various collections like `brands`, `mediaPlanGroups`, `mediaPlanPosts`, `personas`, `affiliateProducts`, `trends`, and `ideas`.
* **Bulk Operations:** Uses `bulkWrite` for efficiency when performing multiple update or insert operations, such as saving a list of ideas or patching multiple posts.
* **ID Handling:** A helper function `createIdFilter` handles converting string IDs from the client into `ObjectId` types, which are the native format for MongoDB's `_id` field.
* **Settings and AI Services:** It manages application settings and information about AI services and models in dedicated collections (`adminSettings`, `brandSettings`, `aiServices`, `aiModels`).
* **Error Handling:** It includes `try...catch` blocks to handle errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `400` for bad requests, `405` for unsupported methods, `500` for server errors).

---

### `/api/gemini.js`

This file is a **Node.js API endpoint** that acts as a middleware for the Google Gemini API. It encapsulates the logic for making calls to Gemini's generative AI models.

Key functionalities include:

* **Text Generation:** The `generate` action takes a model and content to generate a text response.
* **Image Generation:** The `generate-image` action uses Gemini to create an image based on a text prompt.
* **Embeddings:** The `embed` action generates vector embeddings for given text inputs, which is useful for tasks like semantic search and content similarity.
* **API Key Management:** It checks for the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable and throws an error if it's missing, ensuring sensitive data isn't exposed.

---

### `/src/services/databaseService.ts`

This file is a **TypeScript service** for the client-side application. It provides a structured interface for interacting with the `/api/mongodb` API.

Key functionalities include:

* **API Call Abstraction:** It abstracts the low-level `fetch` calls to the `/api/mongodb` endpoint, making it easier for the rest of the application to interact with the database.
* **Caching:** It implements a simple in-memory cache (`dataCache`) to prevent redundant API calls for the same data, improving performance.
* **Named Functions:** It exports functions with clear, descriptive names (e.g., `saveSettings`, `loadMediaPlanGroupsList`) that map to the `action` parameter used in the `/api/mongodb` endpoint.
* **Error Propagation:** It wraps API calls in `try...catch` blocks and re-throws errors to be handled by the UI layer.

---

### `/src/services/bffService.ts`

This file is a **TypeScript service** that acts as a "Backend for Frontend" (BFF) layer, providing a single point of contact for the client to interact with various third-party APIs like Gemini, OpenRouter, and Cloudflare, as well as the internal database API.

Key functionalities include:

* **Centralized API Access:** It consolidates calls to different back-end services, making it easier for the client to manage API interactions.
* **Standardized Fetching:** The `bffFetch` helper function provides a consistent way to make API calls with standardized headers and error handling.
* **Service-Specific Functions:** It exports functions for each external service (e.g., `generateContentWithBff` for Gemini, `publishToFacebookWithBff` for Facebook), abstracting away the specific API endpoint URLs.

Session Summary (2025-09-01)

The bug preventing new brand kits from saving was caused by a **stale state closure** and **silent failure**. 🐞 The `ensureMongoProject` function, a `useCallback` hook, had a missing dependency: the `areCredentialsSet` state variable. This caused the function to retain an outdated `false` value for the credentials status.

***

### Bug Fixes

The `handleGenerateKit` function failed to check the return value of `ensureMongoProject`. Since the latter was returning `null` due to the stale state, the save operation was silently skipped.

* **Dependency Array Update**: To fix this, `areCredentialsSet` was added to the dependency array of the `ensureMongoProject` `useCallback` hook. This ensures the function re-creates itself with the latest `areCredentialsSet` value.

* **Improved Error Handling**: The `handleGenerateKit` function was updated to check for a `null` return value from `ensureMongoProject`. If `null` is returned, a non-blocking toast notification now informs the user that the generated content was not saved to the database due to missing credentials.

The primary file affected was **src/App.tsx**, where the state management and error-handling logic were corrected.

Session Summary (2025-09-02)
### Backend and Frontend Refactoring

The backend and frontend of the application have been refactored to streamline the "brand kit" generation feature. The core change involves **consolidating four separate MongoDB collections** (`brandSettings`, `brandValues`, `keyMessages`, and `logoConcepts`) into a single, main **`brands` collection**.

---

### Key Technical Changes

#### Backend (API)
* **MongoDB Schema:** The `brands` collection now stores all brand-related data, including settings, values, key messages, and logo concepts, within a single document for each brand.
* **API Endpoints:** The API has been updated to use this new, unified data structure.
    * The `create-or-update-brand` endpoint now accepts and saves all brand data in a single call.
    * Endpoints like `fetch-settings`, `save-settings`, `load-complete-project`, and `initial-load` have been modified to query for and retrieve data from the consolidated `brands` collection.
* **Database Consistency:** Database queries have been standardized to use the `_id` field instead of a custom `brandId` to fix an underlying BSONError, ensuring consistent data retrieval and manipulation.

---

#### Frontend (UI)
* **Data Service:** The `databaseService.ts` file has been refactored to align with the new API structure. It now sends and receives the complete, consolidated brand object and no longer contains separate functions for handling individual brand data like settings.
* **UI Components:**
    * **`SettingsModal.tsx`**: This component was changed from a stateful component that fetched its own data to a "dumb" component. It now receives the `settings` object and a save function (`onSave`) as props from a parent component, making it more reusable.
    * **`App.tsx`**: The main application component now manages the `settings` state. It includes a new `handleSaveSettings` function that updates the entire `generatedAssets` state object and then calls `createOrUpdateBrandRecord` to persist the changes to the database.
    * **`BrandProfiler.tsx` and `AssetDisplay.tsx`**: These components required no changes as they were already designed to handle the consolidated data structure.


### Database Cleanup and Bug Fix
* A bug that caused a **`BSONError`** during new brand generation was identified and fixed. The issue was traced to the `ensureMongoProject` function in `App.tsx`, which was passing an incorrect argument to the backend's `createOrUpdateBrandRecord` function. The corrected code ensures that image URLs are properly populated in the assets object before it is sent to the database.
* A subsequent frontend error (`handleSaveSettings is not defined`) was identified as a scope issue in `App.tsx`. The `handleSaveSettings` function has been corrected to use the `useCallback` hook, ensuring it is properly defined and accessible to child components.

The refactoring and fixes are complete, simplifying the database schema and improving the reliability of the brand generation process.

* Bug Triage & Analysis:
      * The initial problem was an Uncaught ReferenceError: handleSaveSettings is not defined originating from App.tsx. This occurred when the SettingsModal component was rendered, as it was passed a non-existent handler for its onSave prop.
      * This led to a follow-up Uncaught SyntaxError after the handler was created, because the underlying saveSettings function it called was not exported from the databaseService.ts module.

* Fix Implementation:
    * `App.tsx` Modifications:
        * A new handleSaveSettings function was implemented using the useCallback hook.
        * This handler was wired to call saveSettings (for brand-specific settings) or saveAdminDefaults (for global settings) from the database service.
        * The databaseService import statement was updated to include saveSettings and saveAdminDefaults.
    * `databaseService.ts` Modifications:
        * A new function, saveSettingsToDatabase, was created. This function makes a fetch call to the backend API endpoint /api/mongodb?action=save-settings, passing the settings object and the brandId.
        * The new saveSettingsToDatabase function was exported with the public alias saveSettings to satisfy the import in App.tsx.

* Outcome:
    * The application-crashing bug was resolved by correctly implementing the full settings-saving logic, from the frontend event handler in App.tsx down to the data-access layer in databaseService.ts.

    Session Summary: Full Airtable Deprecation and Image Upload Refactor

Session Summary (2025-09-02)[2]
The primary goal of this session was to resolve an image upload error and complete the final migration from Airtable to MongoDB by removing all remaining Airtable-related code from the
project.

Initial Problem:
The application was throwing a 404 Not Found error when attempting to upload images. This was caused by the frontend calling a deprecated API endpoint (/api/cloudinary/upload) that did
not align with the consolidated backend routing structure which uses action query parameters (e.g., /api/cloudinary?action=upload).

Solution and Refactoring:

1. Endpoint Correction: The initial 404 error was fixed by updating the bffService.ts to use the correct ?action= parameter for all Cloudinary, Cloudflare, and Facebook API calls.

2. Airtable Code Removal (API):
    * The legacy Airtable request handler was completely removed from api/index.js.
    * The unused utility file api/lib/airtable.js was deleted.

3. Airtable Code Removal (Frontend):
    * The databaseService.ts was refactored to remove all backward-compatibility aliases for Airtable functions (e.g., listBrandsFromAirtable). All data functions now have an explicit
        ...FromDatabase suffix.
    * App.tsx was significantly refactored to:
        * Update all data service calls to use the new, non-aliased function names (e.g., createOrUpdateBrandRecordInDatabase).
        * Remove the now-defunct DatabaseLoadModal component and its related state and event handlers, which were remnants of the Airtable loading workflow.

Outcome:
The image upload functionality is now stable and correctly integrated with the MongoDB backend. All legacy code related to the Airtable database has been scrubbed from the project,
completing the migration.

Session Summary (2025-09-02)[3]
* Completed Airtable Removal: I removed all remaining remnants of the Airtable integration, including the DatabaseLoadModal.tsx component, associated functions and state in App.tsx, and the airtable package itself.
* Fixed Image Pasting in Modals: I resolved an issue where pasting an image into the "Post Detail" modal was not working by adding the necessary event handlers.
* Addressed Image URL Saving: I identified and fixed a bug where imageUrls for "Logo Concepts" were not being saved to MongoDB. This involved:   
	* Updating the LogoConcept and UnifiedProfileAssets types in types.ts to include an imageUrl field.   
	* Modifying the create-or-update-brand action in the backend to initialize these new fields.   
	* Correcting the sync-asset-media backend action to properly update image URLs.
* State Management Refactoring: I lifted the viewingPost state from the MediaPlanDisplay component up to the main App component to ensure the "Post Detail" modal correctly displays updated data after an image is pasted.
* Resolved Build Errors: I fixed multiple build-time and runtime errors related to incorrect function imports and syntax issues that arose during the refactoring process.

## Bug Fixes & Refactoring

This session focused on addressing several critical bugs and completing the refactoring of asset management to use a single, consolidated data structure in MongoDB.

### 1. Fixed Duplicate `logoConcepts` in Database Schema

**Problem:**
The `brands` collection in MongoDB contained two separate fields for logo concepts:
- A top-level `logoConcepts` array (old/deprecated structure).
- A nested `coreMediaAssets.logoConcepts` array (new/consolidated structure).
This caused data inconsistency and confusion.

**Solution:**
- Modified the backend `/api/mongodb.js`:
    - **`create-or-update-brand`**: Removed saving logo concepts to the deprecated top-level field. Now only saves to `coreMediaAssets.logoConcepts`.
    - **`initial-load` & `load-complete-project`**: Updated to load logo concepts exclusively from `brandRecord.coreMediaAssets.logoConcepts`.
    - **`sync-asset-media`**: Simplified to directly update the entire `coreMediaAssets` object sent by the frontend, as it's now the single source of truth.
- Ensured frontend services and components already used `assets.coreMediaAssets.logoConcepts`, so no UI changes were required for data consumption.

### 2. Fixed Loading Existing Logo Images in Brand Kit UI

**Problem:**
When loading an existing brand, logo images that had been previously generated or uploaded were not displayed in the Brand Kit tab. The UI showed the "Generate" or "Upload" placeholder instead of the persisted image.

**Root Cause:**
The `ImageGenerator` component used the `generatedImages` cache (a state in `App.tsx`) to display images, looking them up by `imageKey`. While the initial data load (`loadInitialProjectData`) correctly fetched the `imageUrl` from the database, it did not populate the `generatedImages` cache. This cache was only populated when an image was generated or uploaded during the current session.

**Solution:**
- Modified `handleLoadFromDatabase` in `App.tsx` to pre-populate the `generatedImages` state after loading initial data:
    - Iterates through `brandKitData.coreMediaAssets.logoConcepts` and adds entries to the cache: `{ [logo.imageKey]: logo.imageUrl }`.
    - Also populates cache for `unifiedProfileAssets` if `profilePictureImageUrl` or `coverPhotoImageUrl` exist.
- This ensures that `ImageGenerator` can immediately find and display persisted images upon loading a brand.

### 3. Fixed Post Detail Modal Opening Error

**Problem:**
Clicking on a post card to open the Post Detail modal resulted in a JavaScript error: `Uncaught TypeError: setViewingPost is not a function`.

**Root Cause:**
- `MainDisplay.tsx` expected `viewingPost` and `setViewingPost` as props and passed them down to `MediaPlanDisplay`.
- However, these props were missing from the `MainDisplayProps` interface definition and were not being passed from `App.tsx` when `MainDisplay` was instantiated.

**Solution:**
- Added `viewingPost: PostInfo | null;` and `setViewingPost: (postInfo: PostInfo | null) => void;` to the `MainDisplayProps` interface in `MainDisplay.tsx`.
- Added `viewingPost={viewingPost}` and `setViewingPost={setViewingPost}` to the props list when `MainDisplay` is rendered in `App.tsx`.

### 4. Fixed Post Feed Not Refreshing After Individual Post Changes

**Problem:**
After making changes to a post in the Post Detail modal (e.g., uploading an image) and closing the modal, the main Posts feed did not reflect the changes (e.g., the new image was not shown on the corresponding post card).

**Root Cause:**
- The `assetsReducer` in `App.tsx` uses the `planId`, `weekIndex`, and `postIndex` from a `postInfo` object to locate and update the specific post within the `generatedAssets` state.
- In `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx`, the list of posts rendered in the feed (`paginatedPostInfos`) was constructed with incorrect `weekIndex` and `postIndex` values (hardcoded or based on a flattened list).
- When `handleSetImage` was called from the modal, it passed this incorrect `postInfo`. The reducer used these wrong indices, failed to find the actual post in the nested `plan.plan[weekIndex].posts[postIndex]` structure, and thus never updated the main state. The `generatedImages` cache was updated, but the main data source for the feed was not.

**Solution:**
- Corrected the `paginatedPostInfos` `useMemo` in `MediaPlanDisplay.tsx`:
    - Implemented logic to iterate through the actual `selectedPlan.plan` structure.
    - Created a map to correctly associate each `post.id` with its true `weekIndex` and `postIndex`.
    - Ensured every `PostInfo` object in `paginatedPostInfos` now has the accurate coordinates needed for the reducer to update the correct post in the main state.
- This ensures that changes made in the modal are correctly propagated to the main state, triggering a re-render of the feed with the updated data.

### Session Summary (2025-09-03)

This session focused on significant bug fixing and the implementation of a major new feature, "Auto-Generate Persona Profile". We addressed issues ranging from data synchronization and database operations to UI layout and component-level logic.

### 1. New Feature: Auto-Generate Persona Profile

A new feature was fully implemented to auto-generate multiple, diverse brand personas based on the brand's mission and USP.

*   **Backend:**
    *   A new `auto-generate-persona` action was added to `api/gemini.js`.
    *   The AI prompt was specifically engineered to request an array of 3 diverse personas (including a mix of genders) and to return the data in a structured JSON format.
*   **Database & Types:**
    *   The `Persona` type in `types.ts` was extended with new optional fields: `contentTone`, `visualCharacteristics`, `coreCharacteristics`, `keyMessages`, and `gender`.
    *   The `save-persona` action in `api/mongodb.js` was updated to save these new fields and to robustly handle ID generation, ensuring the `id` and `_id` fields are unified for new documents.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   A new `autoGeneratePersonaProfile` function was added to the service layer to call the new endpoint.
    *   The `PersonasDisplay.tsx` component was updated with an "Auto-Generate" button.
    *   A new modal, `AutoPersonaResultModal.tsx`, was created to display the array of generated personas and allow the user to select which ones to save.
    *   The main `App.tsx` component was updated with new state and handlers (`handleAutoGeneratePersona`, `handleSaveSelectedPersonas`) to manage the entire workflow.

### 2. Bug Fixes & Refinements

*   **Data Synchronization & Stale State:**
    *   **Stale Persona List:** Fixed a bug where the persona list didn't update after a new persona was saved. The `savePersona` function was modified to return the final database ID to the client, and a new `UPDATE_PERSONA_ID` reducer action was implemented in `App.tsx` to synchronize the client-side state.
    *   **Stale Promoted Products:** Fixed a bug where promoted products weren't displayed in the post detail modal. The root cause was that `affiliateLinks` were lazy-loaded. The fix involved updating the `initial-load` backend action and the corresponding frontend services to load affiliate links as part of the initial project data.
*   **Database Operations (`upsert` Bug):**
    *   Identified and fixed a critical, recurring bug where `updateOne` operations with `{ upsert: true }` were creating new, incomplete documents if the filter did not find a match.
    *   This was corrected in `update-media-plan-post` and `save-settings` by removing the `upsert` flag, making these functions true "updates" and preventing data corruption.
*   **UI & Component Logic:**
    *   **Missing Promotion Label:** Fixed a bug where the "Promo" label wasn't showing on `PostCard`s. The component was refactored to derive the promotion status from the `postInfo` prop directly, rather than relying on a derived `promotedProductsCount` prop from the parent.
    *   **Missing Loading Indicators:** Refactored the main tab components (`PersonasDisplay`, `AffiliateVaultDisplay`, `StrategyDisplay`) to remove their internal loading state and correctly use the `isLoading` prop passed from `MainDisplay` to show a loading overlay when data is being fetched.
    *   **Missing `Checkbox` Component:** Resolved a startup crash by creating a new `Checkbox` component in `ui.tsx` and a `CheckIcon` in `icons.tsx`, as they were being imported but did not exist.
*   **API Request Error:**
    *   **Funnel Generation Crash:** Fixed a `400 Bad Request` error from the Google AI API. The `generate` action in `api/gemini.js` was incorrectly nesting the `tools` property inside `generation_config`. The code was corrected to place `tools` at the top level of the API request payload.

### 3. Notes for Future Development

*   **State Synchronization:** The session revealed a recurring pattern of client-side state becoming out of sync with the database after creation operations (e.g., persona IDs, post IDs). **Recommendation:** Ensure all "create" operations in the backend API return the final document ID, and the client-side logic *always* has a mechanism to receive this ID and update its state with this information.
*   **Cautious Use of `upsert`:** The creation of incomplete documents was caused by the misuse of `{ upsert: true }`. **Recommendation:** Use `upsert` with extreme caution. It is only safe when the `$set` operation contains a complete data model for the document. For most cases, a clearer and safer pattern is to explicitly separate "create" and "update" logic.
*   **Component Responsibility:** Note the issue where `PostCard` relied on a derived prop (`promotedProductsCount`) from its parent, which was a point of failure. Making child components more self-reliant by passing them the full data object (`postInfo`) and letting them derive their own state is more robust.
*   **Lazy Loading Complexity:** Mention that the lazy-loading strategy for core data (`affiliateLinks`) caused downstream bugs in components that depended on that data. Suggest that for a given "project" or "brand" context, it might be simpler and more robust to load all associated reference data (like personas, affiliate links) at the start, rather than on a per-tab basis. This simplifies state management and prevents downstream component failures.

## Session Summary (2025-09-04)

This session focused on fixing several bugs related to data synchronization, state management, and UI layout in the "Content Strategy" tab.

### 1. Bug Fixes and Refactoring

**Bug: "Tạo ý tưởng" (Generate Ideas) button in Affiliate Vault was unresponsive.**
- **Analysis:** The `onGenerateIdeasFromProduct` prop was not being passed down from `App.tsx` to the `AffiliateVaultDisplay` component through `MainDisplay.tsx`.
- **Fix:** The prop was added to the `MainDisplayProps` interface, and the handler was correctly passed down through the component tree, restoring the button's functionality.

**Bug: BSONError when saving a new trend generated from a product.**
- **Analysis:** The backend's `save-trend` action was attempting to convert a custom string ID (e.g., `product-xxxx`) into a MongoDB `ObjectId`, which caused a crash.
- **Fix:** The `save-trend` action in `api/mongodb.js` was updated to first validate if the incoming `trend.id` is a valid `ObjectId`. If not, it now correctly creates a new trend with a new database-generated `ObjectId`.

**Bug: New ideas generated from a trend or product were not displayed on the UI without a page reload.**
- **Analysis:** This was a multi-faceted issue:
    1.  A race condition existed where the UI would attempt to re-render before the new ideas were successfully saved to the database.
    2.  The `trendId` assigned to new ideas generated from a product was incorrect (using a `product-` prefix), causing a mismatch with the actual trend ID in the database.
    3.  A stale cache issue was identified where `lazyLoadService.ts` and `databaseService.ts` maintained separate, unsynchronized caches.
- **Fix:**
    1.  The `handleGenerateIdeas` and `handleGenerateIdeasFromProduct` functions in `App.tsx` were refactored to ensure the local state is only updated *after* the new data has been successfully saved to the database and the new database IDs have been returned.
    2.  The logic for creating product-based trends was rewritten to remove the `product-` prefix and to use the correct database ID for the `trendId` field in the idea objects.
    3.  The cache logic was consolidated by removing the local cache in `lazyLoadService.ts` and making it import and use the single cache instance from `databaseService.ts`.

**Bug: Duplicated API calls on home page load.**
- **Analysis:** The duplicated calls were identified as a side effect of React's `StrictMode` in development mode, which intentionally calls `useEffect` hooks twice to detect issues.
- **Fix:** To prevent redundant API calls during development, a `useRef` was implemented in the `useEffect` hooks in both `App.tsx` and `IdeaProfiler.tsx` to ensure that the initial data fetching logic runs only once per component mount.

### 2. Notes for Future Development

- **State Synchronization with Database:** A recurring theme was the client-side state becoming out of sync with the database, especially after creating new documents. **Recommendation:** Always ensure that any "create" operation in the backend API returns the final document (including its database-generated ID), and the client-side logic is designed to receive this new ID and update its state accordingly. This prevents issues with stale data and incorrect IDs.

- **Cache Management:** The presence of two separate data caches led to stale data being served to the UI. **Recommendation:** Maintain a single source of truth for any application-wide cache. Caching logic should be consolidated into a single, dedicated service to avoid synchronization problems.

- **Asynchronous Operations and UI Updates:** Be mindful of race conditions when dealing with asynchronous operations that update the UI. Avoid updating the UI with temporary client-side data before the corresponding backend operation has completed. Whenever possible, wait for the successful completion of the async task and use the data returned from the server to update the state.

- **Clarity on ID Fields:** The project uses both `id` (database `_id`) and `productId` (from affiliate platforms). **Recommendation:** Ensure that the correct ID is used in the correct context to avoid data mismatches. When in doubt, add logging to inspect the objects being passed between functions.

### Session Summary (2025-09-04) [2]

The primary goal of this session was to diagnose and fix a critical performance issue causing extremely long initial application load times (45s+ LCP). The root causes were identified as sequential API calls on startup and an excessively large initial JavaScript bundle.

### 1. Key Accomplishments & Technical Changes

*   **API Call Consolidation:**
    *   The initial separate, sequential API calls for `check-credentials`, `list-brands`, and `fetch-admin-defaults` were identified as a major bottleneck.
    *   A single, consolidated backend action `app-init` was created in `/api/mongodb.js` to perform the work of all three initial calls in one parallel, server-side operation.
    *   The corresponding frontend code in `App.tsx` and `databaseService.ts` was refactored to use a single `initializeApp` function, reducing network round-trips from 3-4 to just one.

*   **Code-Splitting and Lazy Loading:**
    *   The application's entire codebase was being downloaded in a single, multi-megabyte JavaScript file (`App.tsx`), which severely delayed rendering.
    *   Implemented aggressive code-splitting using `React.lazy()` and `<Suspense>`.
    *   All major views (`IdeaProfiler`, `BrandProfiler`, `MainDisplay`, `AdminPage`) and all modal dialogs (`SettingsModal`, `ScheduleModal`, etc.) across the application are now loaded dynamically on demand, rather than all at once. This dramatically reduces the initial bundle size.

*   **Dependency & State Refactoring:**
    *   Fixed multiple `Uncaught SyntaxError` crashes that occurred after the initial refactoring. These were caused by child components (`configService.ts`, `IdeaProfiler.tsx`) trying to import and call functions that had been deleted from `databaseService.ts`.
    *   Refactored `IdeaProfiler.tsx` to remove its own data-fetching logic. It now receives the list of brands as a prop from the main `App.tsx` component, which is a more efficient and standard React pattern.
    *   Refactored `configService.ts` to be a simple state container that gets initialized by `App.tsx`, removing its own API-calling capabilities.

### 2. Notes for Future Development

*   **Thoroughness of Refactoring:** When consolidating an API or function, it is critical to perform a global search to find and update **all** call sites. Simply creating the new function is not enough; the old functions and their corresponding calls must be fully removed to prevent errors and redundant network requests.
*   **Data Flow:** The session highlighted the importance of a clear, top-down data flow. The final, correct pattern involved the top-level `App.tsx` component fetching all necessary initial data once, and then passing that data down to child components via props. This should be the preferred pattern over having individual child components fetch their own data.
*   **Assume Nothing About Imports:** The errors I introduced were from making assumptions about which modules were importing the functions I deleted. A future best practice will be to actively search for usages of a function across the codebase *before* deleting it.
*   **Browser Cache:** While the issues in this session were code-related, the initial symptoms (old API calls still appearing) were characteristic of a browser cache issue. It's important to remember to instruct users to perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) after significant frontend changes are deployed.
